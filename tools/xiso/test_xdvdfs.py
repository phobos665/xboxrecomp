"""
Self-check for the XDVDFS reader.

Run: py -3 tools/xiso/test_xdvdfs.py

Builds a synthetic disc image in memory rather than depending on a real one, so
this runs anywhere. The properties worth pinning:

  - the partition base is found by probing for the magic, not guessed from file
    size, because images come as bare game partitions and with a video partition
    in front;
  - directory entries are walked per-sector rather than by following the binary
    tree's left/right links, so a padded or malformed link cannot silently drop
    a whole subtree. Losing a file quietly is worse than being slow;
  - a non-XDVDFS file fails loudly instead of returning an empty listing, which
    would otherwise read as "this disc has no files on it".
