Recover C++ classes, vtables and virtual methods from an XBE's MSVC RTTI.

A title compiled as C++ with RTTI left enabled carries, in the shipping binary,
a complete description of its own class graph. Where it is present this is the
single richest symbol source on the platform, because unlike a name-only string
table it points at *code*:

  * every polymorphic class name, as a decorated ".?AV...@@" TypeDescriptor
  * every vtable -- MSVC stores the CompleteObjectLocator at vtable[-1], so a
    word pointing at a COL is immediately followed by the method array
  * every virtual method address, by walking that array
  * the full inheritance chain, from the ClassHierarchyDescriptor

The addresses are also *proof of function entry points*, which is what makes
this worth running before disassembly rather than after: see seeds() and
docs/technical/rtti-recovery.md.

Most Xbox titles are C, or C++ with RTTI disabled, and yield nothing. That is a
normal result, not a failure -- callers get empty dicts and should carry on.

Structures (32-bit MSVC; all fields are plain VAs, with none of the
image-relative indirection x64 RTTI uses):

    TypeDescriptor            { void *vfptr; void *spare; char name[]; }
    CompleteObjectLocator     { u32 sig; u32 offset; u32 cdOffset;
                                TypeDescriptor *pTD; ClassHierarchyDescriptor *pCD; }
    ClassHierarchyDescriptor  { u32 sig; u32 attributes; u32 numBaseClasses;
                                BaseClassDescriptor **pBaseClassArray; }
