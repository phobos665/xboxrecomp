tools/seed_from_log/__main__.py

Feed function addresses a *run* discovered back into the seed file, so the next
codegen pass knows about them.

Static analysis cannot see every function. Two kinds are routinely invisible:

  * **Indirect-call targets.** Where a vtable call goes is a runtime fact.
    (`tools.rtti` recovers these statically when a title has RTTI; most do not.)
  * **Thread start routines.** The address handed to PsCreateSystemThreadEx is
    only ever pushed as an argument -- nothing calls it -- so the detector never
    finds it, it gets no dispatch entry, and the game thread silently never
    starts. The process then exits cleanly after two kernel calls, which reads
    like a successful run rather than zero progress. This is the single most
    common "it built and did nothing" cause.

Usage:

    py -3 -m tools.seed_from_log run.log game/title.xbe \
        --functions build/disasm/functions.json \
        --seeds     config/seed_functions.json

Then re-run disasm with --seed-functions and lift again.

An address the title mentioned is NOT automatically a function. A garbage slot
points at data just as easily, and seeding data splits real functions and breaks
the build far more thoroughly than the missing target did. Every candidate must
clear two gates:

  1. it lies in an executable section, and
  2. the disassembler's own probe reads it as a function body.

Both are needed. The probe alone accepts data that happens to decode -- a kernel
thunk table is a run of code addresses and decodes happily -- and on Wreckless
seeding two of its entries once took a boot that reached 34 assets down to 1.
