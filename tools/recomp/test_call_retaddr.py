"""
Self-check for guest return addresses on the simulated stack.

Run: py -3 tools/recomp/test_call_retaddr.py

Regression guard for two coupled bugs:

1. `call` pushed a literal 0 instead of the address of the following
   instruction. `ret` never reads the slot, so this was invisible until guest
   code did -- __SEH_prolog finds its scope table through [esp], _alloca probes
   walk back to it, and "mov eax, [esp]" is the standard CRT idiom for "who
   called me". All of them saw 0.

2. _fixup_icall_esp_save walked backwards from an ICALL looking for the run of
   argument pushes, and tested `startswith('PUSH32(esp,')` before it tested for
   a direct call. A direct call is emitted as "PUSH32(esp, <retva>); name();"
   on one line, so it matched as an argument push and the scan ran straight
   through it -- putting the _icall_esp save before a call that had already
   returned, so a failing ICALL rewound g_esp too far.
