"""
Self-check for the indirect-branch target feedback loop.

Run: py -3 tools/recomp/test_icall_feedback.py

The properties that matter:
  - a truncated dump still parses (it is written from a dying process)
  - the database is CUMULATIVE across runs; a target seen once is never lost
    because a later run did not reach it. Without that the loop cannot
    converge, it just reports whatever the last run happened to touch.
  - flags accumulate rather than overwrite: a target that was unresolved in
    run 1 and resolved in run 2 must end up as both, so the history is
    visible instead of being silently repaired.
  - the database is directly loadable by tools/disasm --seed-functions, with
    no conversion step.
