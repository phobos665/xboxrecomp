"""
Replace XDK library functions by name instead of lifting them.

The DOAXBV port reached gameplay by replacing D3D8 at its API and translating
to D3D11, never emulating the GPU underneath. It found each D3D8 function by a
hard-coded address, which makes the replacement one game's. Here the address
comes from tools.xdk_symbols (XbSymbolDatabase signatures), and the
replacement is keyed by the XDK function's *name*, so one implementation of
D3DDevice_SetTexture serves every title whose XDK build the database covers.

Mechanism, reusing what the recompiler already does for hand-written code:

  * an implemented name's address joins the `manual` set, so its body is not
    lifted and every direct call routes through the runtime lookup;
  * a generated `recomp_hle.c` defines that address's `sub_XXXXXXXX` as a
    thunk that calls `hle_<Name>` and then pops the stack.

The thunk, not the implementation, pops the stack, and the count comes from
the original function's own `ret N`. The signature database's parameter lists
are right for 311 of the 314 D3D8 and DirectSound functions checked against
the lifted code in Burnout 2 -- and wrong for three, which would leave esp off
in every caller. The binary cannot be wrong about what it pops.

Implementations mark themselves with `HLE_EXPORT(Name)`; this module scans for
that marker the way manual_scan scans recomp_manual.c, so the list of what is
replaced cannot drift from what is written.
