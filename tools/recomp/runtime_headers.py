"""The runtime headers that travel with generated code, and which file needs which.

templates/runtime/recomp_types.h is the register model every generated file
includes. Its SSE/XMM/MMX half lives in recomp_types_simd.h, which
recomp_types.h includes unless RECOMP_NO_SIMD is defined first. Most chunks
use none of it -- 3 of TimeSplitters 2's 28 do -- so a generated file that
names nothing the SIMD header defines says so with RECOMP_NO_SIMD, and a
change to that header rebuilds only the files that use it.

The names are read from the header itself, so a helper added there is
covered here without a second list to keep in step. A wrong answer cannot
pass silently: a file that claims RECOMP_NO_SIMD and then uses a SIMD helper
fails to compile (an undeclared helper is an error in every build).
