"""
Hold src/kernel/nv2a_vsh.c's microcode field table to a known-good program.

    python3 -m pytest tools/vsh_audit/test_vsh_encoding.py

The NV2A vertex program encoding is packed into four dwords with no slack, and
a field table that is wrong does not fail loudly: it decodes to *some* program,
and the shader that comes out is garbage with no error anywhere. The previous
table placed the opcodes in dword0, which is zero in every instruction of every
program observed -- so every instruction read as MAC=NOP, ILU=NOP, and both the
HLSL generator and the CPU interpreter produced nothing while reporting success.

This test parses the VSH_FIELD_* constants straight out of the C source and
decodes Burnout 2's frontend shader with them, so the constants themselves are
what is under test. It is the same technique tools/kernel_audit uses against
kernel_bridge.c.

Ground truth is docs/technical/nv2a-vertex-program-encoding.md, whose
disassembly was produced by abaire/nv2a_vsh_asm -- an independent assembler for
this instruction set -- and is the canonical Xbox pass-through shader:

     0  MOV R1.xyzw, v0
     1  MOV oD0.xyzw, v3      + RCP R1.w, R1.w
     2  RCP oFog.xyzw, v0.w
     3  MUL R2.xyzw, R1, c[0] + MOV oD1.xyzw, v4
     4  ADD oPos.xyzw, R2, c[1]
     5  MOV oPts.xyzw, v1.x
     6  MOV oB0.xyzw, v7          9  MOV oT1.xyzw, v10
     7  MOV oB1.xyzw, v8         10  MOV oT2.xyzw, v11
     8  MOV oT0.xyzw, v9         11  MOV oT3.xyzw, v12
