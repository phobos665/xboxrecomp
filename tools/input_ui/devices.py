"""
What is plugged in, and what is being pressed on it.

XInput through ctypes: the UI needs to list the pads that answer right now,
and, while capturing a binding, to notice the first control that moves. No
DirectInput and no raw HID -- an Xbox-layout pad is what XInput reports, and
anything else on Windows is either seen by XInput or needs a translation
layer this toolkit does not have.

Everything here degrades to "no pads" rather than raising, so the UI runs on a
machine with no XInput at all (and so the tests can import it anywhere).
