# xboxrecomp fork — working context

Fork of `sp00nznet/xboxrecomp`. Goal: static recompilation of original Xbox titles into
native executables, generalised beyond the single proven target.

This file lives at the repo root; Claude Code reads it automatically each session.

## The framing to hold onto

**The performance win comes from HLE at the D3D8 boundary — not from lifting CPU code, and
not from the graphics backend.**

Guest is x86-32 little-endian, host is x86-64 little-endian. No byte swapping, 8 guest GPRs
into 16 host GPRs, guest EFLAGS semantics *are* host EFLAGS semantics. Same-ISA translation is
already near-native, and a 733 MHz Coppermine P3 leaves enormous headroom. Frame time goes into
NV2A work — push-buffer parsing, PGRAPH state decode, texture cache invalidation, write-watch
traps — none of which static CPU recompilation touches.

Consequences:

- Recompiled output will **not** beat xemu on a desktop x86 machine unless D3D8 is HLE'd.
- Naive lifted C can be *slower* than a tuned JIT. There is no deficit to start from, so
  codegen quality has to be good just to break even.
- The genuine wins are: HLE'ing D3D8, ARM hosts (where x86-32 → ARM64 is no longer same-ISA
  and lifting genuinely pays), moddability, and portability once the memory model is fixed.

**Why HLE generalises here but not on the 360:** there is no `d3d8.dll` on the Xbox — D3D8 is
statically linked into the XBE, and it is a known, versioned library. Cxbx-Reloaded has spent
fifteen years building OOVPA signature databases identifying it *per-XDK-build*. So the HLE
boundary is per-XDK-version, not per-game, and there is a manageable number of those.

## Corrections to the upstream README

Verify against the repo rather than trusting the README. Known discrepancies as of August 2026:

| README says | Reality (per `docs/technical/gap-analysis.md`) |
|---|---|
| NV2A push-buffer interception is a core feature | Push-buffer parsing is a **stub**, marked "N/A — D3D8 API intercept instead". The project already does D3D8 HLE. |
| "115 of 366 ordinals resolved, 55 bridged" | Do not trust any number written down; the useful question is per-title, not global. Run `py -3 -m tools.kernel_audit.coverage <analysis.json> --list`, which splits what is missing into "needs a bridge wrapper", "is a data export", and "does not exist yet". Note an ordinal with an `xbox_*` implementation but no bridge silently returns 0. |
| Portable C output targeting ARM, RISC-V, WASM | Memory model uses `CreateFileMapping` + fixed-address `MapViewOfFileEx` at guest VAs. Win32-only in practice. |
| Burnout 3 is the proven target | True, and it is a **D3D8LTCG** build on XDK 5849 — so LTCG is not disqualifying. |

**Corrected Sep 2026:** that "17 of 66 formats, mipmap level 0 only, no P8 palette, no
texture coordinate generation" line described the *software rasteriser*, not the texture
layer. `src/d3d/d3d8_resources.c` maps ~120 `D3DFMT_` enumerators, builds full mip chains,
handles cube and volume textures, and bakes P8 through the stage palette;
`src/d3d/d3d8_shaders.c` does texture coordinate generation. `src/d3d` is 12.5k lines and
is the renderer. The generalisation blocker is not the texture layer.

**The real blocker was that `src/hle` could not see `src/d3d`.** It can now (Sep 2026):
`xbox_hle` links `xbox_d3d8` on Windows, and `hle_d3d8.c` replaces 40 XDK functions by
name. Each runs the title's own body first (`HLE_ORIGINAL`), and with
`RECOMP_HLE_D3D8=shadow` repeats the call on a host device in a second window.

**Shadow mode draws the title** (Sep 2026): Burnout 2's logos, menus, loading screens, HUD
and race, with its own vertex programs and register combiners. See
`docs/technical/shadow-mode.md` for what reaches the host and from where, the switches, and
the gaps that remain (cube render targets, `CopyRects`, lighting). A path for titles that
fill push buffers through `BeginPush` is still the next piece of work: those draws reach no
replacement at all.

**Second title (Sep 2026): TimeSplitters 2, XDK 4721.** Boots through XAPI start-up,
DirectSound and its first frames with **no overrides**; see
`docs/technical/second-title-bringup.md` for the six things it proved were wrongly
universal (retail disc check, GPU time fence offsets, DSP doorbell, the APU's physical
view, two template gaps) and what is next. Its draws reach the shadow renderer and are
skipped: 4721 loads vertex programs through `LoadVertexShaderProgram` /
`SelectVertexShaderDirect`, which `src/hle` does not replace yet, so no program is ever
known. Both titles need `RECOMP_VBLANK=1 RECOMP_AC97_READY=1` to pace and to get through
audio init; the DSP doorbell is found from the scratch page table, so `RECOMP_APU_DSP_ACK`
is only an override now.

**Update, 18 Sep 2026 evening:** the 4721 shader paths are replaced (`LoadVertexShaderProgram`,
`SelectVertexShaderDirect`, pointer-form pixel shaders), and with a scripted menu path
(`RECOMP_INPUT_SEQ`, see the bring-up doc) TimeSplitters 2 loads the Siberia level and renders
its opening cutscene, at 85-145 fps uncapped. Not yet playable: the level is dark and ~15% of
in-level draws are skipped as "program without layout". Two of the three blockers on the way
were not the title: the entry profiler at a 100-call interval (now capped at one report a
second) and a switch table the disassembler never measured (`resync_jump_tables()` now runs
before every function rebuild). When a title "hangs" after drawing, suspect the diagnostics
first, and when it spins on an `[ICALL] unknown target` a few bytes past a function end, look
for a `jmp [reg*4 + table]` just before it.

**Update, 19 Sep 2026:** TimeSplitters 2 plays. The dark level was stale blend and depth
state (`SetRenderState_Simple` is now stored), the black story intro was a DirectSound
stream status word (`DSSTREAMSTATUS_PLAYING` is 0x10000), the last unresolved indirect
call was a switch arm the translator lost after a re-sync, and both titles are lifted
without `--trace-all-entries`. The level runs 80 fps uncapped on this machine, so the
**flip gate is on by default in adaptive mode** (`RECOMP_FPS_CAP=0` to switch it off,
`=60`/`=30` for the strict console cadence); the measurements behind that are in
`docs/technical/resolution-and-framerate.md`. The performance plan in
`docs/technical/ts2-performance-plan.md`, items 1-7, took the level from 12.4 ms a frame to
5.0 ms (branch `perf/ts2-items-1-7`). From the user's first pad session: `D3DDevice_SetScissors`
is forwarded (the briefing text was spilling out of its box), and closing the game window
exits the process.

**Input is bound, not hard-coded (Sep 2026):** all four ports read
`src/input/input_bindings.c`, which loads a JSON config — `RECOMP_INPUT_CONFIG`, else
`%APPDATA%\xboxrecomp\input_bindings.json`, else one beside the executable — and falls
back to exactly the old behaviour when there is none. `py -3 -m tools.input_ui` is the UI
that writes it. See `docs/technical/input-binding.md`. `RECOMP_FAKE_INPUT` and
`RECOMP_INPUT_SEQ` still apply to controller 1 and ignore the bindings.

Two things that cost days and are worth knowing before touching this code. The title's
**deferred render state arrays do not follow its pixel shader** — `SetPixelShader` selects
an object carrying a `D3DPIXELSHADERDEF`, and the arrays hold whichever shader last went
through them. And an Xbox surface says what it is through its **parent**: without
forwarding `SetRenderTarget`, an offscreen pass's clear wipes the screen, which is what
kept Burnout 2's world black.

**Backend decision (Sep 2026): Vulkan**, for portability — Linux, Steam Deck, Android.
The shader generators stay as they are: `d3d8_combiners.c`, `d3d8_vsh.c` and
`d3d8_shaders.c` emit HLSL, and DXC compiles HLSL to SPIR-V, so ~4k lines of translation
survive the move. Do **not** rewrite them to GLSL. Vulkan's costs here are the Y-flip and
front-face winding inversion (a negative viewport height; note `d3d8_states.c` already
carries one hand-annotated winding fix, so do not stack a second).

The A/B problem is solved: **frame capture and replay** (`src/hle/d3d8_capture.h`,
`src/replay`) records one frame's host calls and plays them back with no game running, so
one frame can be drawn by two backends and compared. That is the bring-up loop for a Vulkan
backend, and it needs no D3D11On12-style bridge.

## Planned changes, in dependency order

The first four get baked into generated code and are expensive to retrofit. **Do these before
any bulk codegen.**

### 1. Memory model
Move from fixed-VA mapping to base+offset. Reserve 4 GB. Keep guest pointers **32-bit** — they
live inside guest structs, so widening them breaks every layout. Implement mirror regions as
multiple mappings of one shared object. This is what makes the project portable off Win32.

### 2. Register model
Replace global `g_eax`-style registers plus the simulated stack in a guest memory array with a
per-function context struct and local temporaries. The globals defeat aliasing analysis and
register allocation, which is why naive lifted output loses to a JIT.

### 3. x87 policy
The Xbox is SSE1-only, so era compilers emit x87 for doubles. `long double` is 80-bit on x86
GCC/Clang, 64-bit on MSVC, 128-bit on AArch64 — bit-exactness is not portable for free.
Decision: `double` by default, with a per-function soft-float80 escape hatch. Settle this
before the lifter emits its first FP instruction.

### 4. Threading
The Xbox is uniprocessor. Guest code raises IRQL as mutual exclusion and spins without
barriers. Keep the cooperative single-thread model, but inject **yield checks at loop
back-edges** so a spinning guest thread cannot deadlock.

### 5. Separate engine from per-title data — **upstream owns this now**
Overrides stay in `recomp_manual.c`. Upstream's `tools/recomp/manual_scan.py` treats that
file as the single source of truth for which `sub_XXXXXXXX` are hand-defined, and the
recompiler reads it to decide what *not* to generate — so a second override file causes
duplicate symbols and unresolved externals. A fork-local split was tried here and reverted.

The mandatory-reason-per-override idea is still right and still unenforced. The place to
land it is upstream, as a convention plus a check over `recomp_manual.c`, not as a
competing file.

The kernel thunk table is already per-title upstream: `xbox_kernel_init()` reads ordinals
from the mapped XBE, keeps `g_thunk_ordinals` only as a no-XBE fallback, and adds
`xbox_kernel_set_ordinal_remap()` on top.

### 6. Then, in rough order of what they unlock
- **Texture layer** — table-drive formats, mip levels, P8 palette, texcoord generation.
  XDK-independent, and the thing most likely to stop title #2 even on the same XDK.
- **Function discovery quality** — better indirect-branch analysis, vtable recovery, seeding.
  Every unresolved ICALL becomes a per-game override that doesn't transfer, so this directly
  attacks per-title cost.
- **XDK signature coverage** — an *identification* problem, not a reimplementation one. The
  D3D8 API surface is stable; what changes per build is where functions sit. Much of this is
  porting Cxbx-Reloaded's OOVPA work. LTCG builds are harder but demonstrably tractable.
- **Kernel ordinal coverage** — driven by what titles call, not by XDK version; accumulates
  naturally. Audit per-title with `tools.kernel_audit.coverage`.
- **LLE fallback** — for titles that hand-roll push buffers or defeat signature matching.
  Shipping working-but-slow, then converting to the fast path, is what makes this a toolkit
  rather than a collection of per-game hacks.
- ~~**Pipeline driver script**~~ — done: `scripts/recompile.py`, defaults to `--game-only`,
  with `--from`/`--only` to resume part-way.

---

## Pipeline

Tools run as Python modules from the repo root (`py -3` on Windows, `python3` on Linux).

```
extract-xiso  ->  tools.xbe_parser  ->  tools.disasm  ->  tools.func_id
                                                              |
                     cmake build  <-  tools.recomp  <---------+
```

All four stages at once (this is the normal path):

```bash
python3 scripts/recompile.py game_files/default.xbe
```

Or stage by stage:

```bash
py -3 -m tools.xbe_parser  game_files/default.xbe --json game_files/g_analysis.json
py -3 -m tools.disasm      game_files/default.xbe --text-only -v
py -3 -m tools.func_id     game_files/default.xbe -v
py -3 -m tools.recomp      game_files/default.xbe --game-only --split 1000
```

The `--json` from step one is **required** by the disassembler — it reads section layout from
it. Keep it beside the XBE.

Use `--game-only` when bringing up a new title. Lifting CRT and XDK code you intend to HLE away
wastes compile time and debugging attention. Switch to `--all` only when needed.

**Two titles at once (this fork):** every stage defaults to one shared `tools/*/output`,
and the recompiler's title guard compares file names only, so two `default.xbe`s overwrite
each other silently. Give each title its own outputs and project:

```bash
py -3 scripts/recompile.py "games/<title>/default.xbe" \
    --work-dir games/_pipeline/<name>/out --project titles/<name>
```

Add `--trace-all-entries` only while bringing a title up: it puts a hook at every lifted
function's entry (for `[TRACE]` lines, `RECOMP_TRACE_ONLY`, the entry profiler and the
"main thread stops entering new functions" diagnosis) and costs a few percent of frame
time. A plain lift keeps `RECOMP_SAMPLE` and the kernel log. Both titles are lifted plain
now; TimeSplitters 2 was re-lifted plain on 19 Sep 2026 with no change in behaviour.

Projects live in `titles/<name>/` (committed: CMakeLists, `main.c`, `recomp_manual.c`),
game data in `games/<title>/` and stage output in `games/_pipeline/<name>/out` (both
ignored). Regenerate a title's `main.c` from the template with
`scripts/regen_title_main.py` rather than editing the copy. On this machine CMake is the
one bundled with VS 2019 Build Tools; there is no VS 2022 and none is needed.

## Debug loop

Build with `--game-only` → run → read stderr → classify → fix → rebuild. Most project time
lives here.

| stderr shows | Cause |
|---|---|
| `[ICALL] unknown target 0x... from RVA 0x...` | Target never detected as a function. Re-run discovery with `--seed-functions`, or add a manual override. |
| Access violation at `0xFD......` | GPU MMIO — NV2A hooks not initialised |
| Access violation at `0xFE......` | APU MMIO — audio hooks not initialised |
| `SKIP-READ` | Unmapped access; often a native pointer where a guest VA was expected |
| Infinite loop | Waiting on hardware state — stub the wait or fake the state |
| Stack overflow | Wrong ESP at entry, or runaway recursion |
| **Subtly wrong physics or RNG, no crash** | **x87 precision divergence — suspect this first when behaviour differs from xemu without a fault** |
| A key or pad does nothing, and no `[INPUT] port N first press` line appears | The binding, not the title. `[INPUT] bindings from ...` at start-up names the config that was loaded and the device on each port; `py -3 -m tools.input_ui --print` shows what it holds |
| Exits via `HalReturnToFirmware` after ~15 kernel calls | XAPI's retail disc check failed (certificate `AllowedMedia` is DVD-X2 only). The kernel answers it since Sep 2026; if it recurs, look at the mode-sense reply in `kernel_bridge.c` |
| Main thread stops entering new functions right after the first `Swap`; ISR keeps ticking | `D3D_BlockOnTime` waiting for the GPU time fence. The HLE mirrors it from `D3D_BlockOnTime`'s prologue; a "not mirrored" line in the log means this XDK's prologue differs |
| Stops in DirectSound start-up, watchdog shows `ebx = <block>+0x810` | The DSP doorbell. Found from `GPSADDR`/`EPSADDR` under `RECOMP_AC97_READY`; without that switch DirectSound never gets this far and the title dereferences a half-built sound object instead |
| Draws keep coming but `Swap` slows to one every many seconds, no crash, `[FPS]` near 0 | Look at your own switches first. `--profile` (entry profiler) and a `--trace-all-entries` build printing `[TRACE]` lines both cost more per function entry than the title does; `RECOMP_SAMPLE=500` shows it as `NtWriteFile`/`prof_report`. Rerun with `RECOMP_TRACE_BUDGET=0` and no `--profile` before believing the title is stuck |

Overrides live in `recomp_manual.c` and are checked before the auto-generated table, so they
always win. `manual_scan.py` parses that file to decide what not to generate, so keep them
there and nowhere else. **Log every override with its reason at the moment you add it** —
nothing enforces this yet, which is why it gets skipped.

**Bring-up order:** CRT startup → hardware init → asset loading → menus → gameplay. Get to a
black screen with no crashes before caring about rendering.

**Reference oracle:** run the title in xemu with its GDB stub. For the no-crash divergence case,
bisect — break at a function in xemu, dump registers, dump the same context struct at the same
point in the lifted build, find the first disagreement. Add a state-dump hook to lifted output
early so this is a flag rather than a rebuild.

Ghidra is static analysis of the XBE (a second opinion on `tools.func_id`), not a live view of
a running game. Its debugger module can attach to xemu's GDB stub, but expect to fight it over
i386 detection. Not a prerequisite.

---

## Choosing the next target

**LTCG status and engine cannot be determined from wikis** — LTCG is a per-build linker setting
recorded nowhere public. Run the survey script over extracted discs (it exists now, and ranks
candidates; `scripts/make_test_xbe.py` builds synthetic XBEs for testing it without game files):

```bash
python3 scripts/survey_xbe_library.py /path/to/extracted/discs --csv survey.csv
python3 scripts/survey_xbe_library.py /path/to/one/default.xbe --verbose
```

It reads XBE headers directly and reports XDK version, D3D8 vs D3D8LTCG, library list,
RenderWare detection and version, `.text` size, kernel import count, and demand-loaded
sections. Treat the ranking as a starting point — it cannot see hand-rolled push buffers,
threading complexity, or whether you want to play the game.

Good first targets: small `.text`, RenderWare or another documented engine, no XONLINE, no
WMADEC, few demand-loaded sections. Criterion titles (Burnout 1/2) overlap most with the
existing reference implementation. Avoid GTA as a *first* target despite being canonical
RenderWare — large, threaded, streaming-heavy. Avoid 2001–2002 launch titles, which sometimes
use debug-era XDK patterns.

**Strategy:** bring up a second title on XDK 5849 first. Anything that breaks is by definition
something the project wrongly treated as universal. A third title on a different XDK then
isolates what is version-specific. That converts "it only does Burnout 3" into a work queue.

---

## Legal

The toolkit ships engine and tooling code, not game content. Recompiling requires game files
from a copy you own. Do not distribute recompiled binaries containing game code or assets, and
do not redistribute XDK library code recovered during signature work.

---

## Note on xboxlle-probe

`mstan/xboxlle-probe` is an nxdk agent listening on TCP 4380 that answers requests: named
read-only CPU/NV2A probes, guarded RAM/MMIO/flash reads, and — in armed unsafe mode — writes
and uploaded x86 payload execution. It is a **poke-and-read hardware oracle, not an instruction
tracer**, and has no Ghidra integration. Its named probes use a fixed register set tested on
one Xbox v1.1, and `controller-s-hub` is an admitted stub.

Its real value here is as ground truth for x87 precision — upload small test payloads via
`EXEC`, read results back — and for MMIO read side effects on the LLE fallback path. Flash
dumps contain per-console secrets and unique identifiers; never commit them.
