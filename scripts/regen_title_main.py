"""Rewrite titles/<name>/src/main.c from templates/new-game/src/main.c.

The title projects in titles/ differ from the template only in three defines
(entry point, XBE path, game directory) and the banner name. Keeping them as
copies means a template fix has to be applied by hand to each; this applies it.

    py -3 scripts/regen_title_main.py burnout2 "Burnout 2" 0x000E2555 "Burnout 2 - Point of Impact"

Or every title at once, each keeping the name, entry point and game folder its
current main.c already has:

    py -3 scripts/regen_title_main.py --all

Paths are written relative to the executable's directory,
titles/<name>/build/<Config>/, which is where scripts/run_and_report.py
starts it from. They are spelt with backslashes, as Windows does; the runtime
turns them into forward slashes elsewhere (xbox_path_normalize).
