Run every title and print one table of how far each one got.

The bring-up loop has always been one title at a time, and so has every
judgement about whether a change helped: the NtFreeVirtualMemory fix, the
LOCK-prefix flag fix and the XDK 3925 work were each validated against a
single game. "Did this regress Burnout 2" was not a question anyone could
answer without half an hour of manual runs, so it mostly went unasked.

This asks it. Each title is built, run headless for a fixed time, and reduced
to the handful of numbers that say where its frontier is:

    title            boot  device  swaps  draws  skipped  tex refused  icalls
    burnout2          yes     yes   1204   8817        0            0       0
    timesplitters2    yes     yes    903  12044       31            0       2
    maxpayne          yes     yes    122    239        0            0       2
    mkda              yes     yes      0      0        0            0       2
    ...

With --baseline it prints the same table against a previous run's JSON and
marks every column that moved, which is the actual question: not "how good is
this title" but "did what I just changed break one of the others".

    py -3 scripts/compat_matrix.py --refresh-thunks --build --seconds 45
    py -3 scripts/compat_matrix.py --baseline runs/matrix-before.json

Titles are discovered from titles/*/src/main.c, which records the game
directory and entry point. A title with no built executable is reported as
such rather than skipped, because "it stopped building" is a regression too.

These are windowed programs: a run opens a window per title, in sequence.
