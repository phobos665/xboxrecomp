 Static Recompilation Toolkit for Original Xbox Games
```

> Turn any Xbox game binary into a native Windows executable. No emulation. No interpreter. Just raw, recompiled C.

**Current version: v0.6.0 — _"Credit Where Due"_ (August 2026).**
See the [Changelog](#changelog) for what landed and when.

---

## What Is This?

This is a complete toolkit for **statically recompiling original Xbox (2001-2005) games** from their retail XBE executables into native Windows programs.

Static recompilation takes the raw x86 machine code from an Xbox binary and translates every function — every `mov`, every `jmp`, every `call` — into equivalent C source code. That C code compiles with MSVC into a native x86-64 `.exe` that runs on modern Windows. The game's original logic executes directly on your CPU, not through an interpreter or JIT compiler.

**This is the first *public* static recompilation toolkit for the original Xbox.**
Microsoft got here first: their internal Ficl/Fission recompiler shipped Xbox
back-compat on the 360. We have since studied it — see
[Microsoft's Own Recompiler](docs/technical/ms-fusion-recompiler.md).

The technique has been proven on other platforms — [N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp) showed MIPS-to-C was viable, [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) brought it to Xbox 360's PowerPC — but nobody had tackled the OG Xbox until now. Its x86 architecture makes it both easier (same instruction set family as the host) and harder (variable-length instructions, complex addressing modes, x87 FPU stack) than MIPS or PPC targets.

### Why Not Just Use an Emulator?

Emulators are great. Cxbx-Reloaded and xemu do incredible work. But static recomp offers some unique advantages:

- **Native performance** — recompiled code runs at full speed, no interpretation overhead
- **Moddability** — the output is human-readable C code; you can patch, extend, and improve the game
- **Portability** — the C output can target any platform with a C compiler (ARM, RISC-V, WebAssembly...)
- **Preservation** — a self-contained native binary is the ultimate form of game preservation
- **Understanding** — the process forces you to deeply understand the game at the machine code level

## Runtime Libraries

Following the [RexGlueSDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) pattern (which does the same for Xbox 360 via Xenia), xboxrecomp provides link-time libraries extracted from [xemu](https://github.com/xemu-project/xemu) and purpose-built compatibility layers. Your recompiled game links against these — no emulator needed at runtime.

| Library | Source | What It Does |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **xbox_kernel** | Custom | Xbox kernel → Win32 (152 of the kernel's 371 ordinals routed, 112 with dedicated bridges: memory, file I/O, threading, sync, crypto, HAL, EEPROM, SMBus) |
| **xbox_d3d8** | Custom | D3D8 → D3D11 graphics: **4-stage multi-texture** FFP pipeline, **NV2A register combiner** pixel shaders, **programmable vertex shaders** (NV2A microcode → HLSL), **hardware T&L lighting** (8 lights), **vertex fog**, DrawPrimitiveUP ring buffer, texture unswizzling, 20+ format conversions |
| **xbox_dsound** | Custom | DirectSound → software mixer (IDirectSound8/IDirectSoundBuffer8) |
| **xbox_apu** | xemu *(LGPL-2.1+)* | MCPX APU audio (256-voice processor, ADPCM/PCM, envelopes, HRTF, waveOut output) |
| **xbox_nv2a** | xemu *(regs, LGPL-2.1+)* + Custom | NV2A GPU (register handlers, MMIO interception, push buffer parsing, PGRAPH → D3D11 translation) |
| **xbox_input** | Custom | Xbox gamepad → XInput |

### Building the Libraries

```bash
cd xboxrecomp
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

This produces 6 static libraries in `build/src/*/Release/`. Link your game project against `xboxrecomp` (umbrella target) or individual libraries.

### Integration Pattern

Your recompiled game provides two callback functions that the kernel bridge calls to resolve function addresses:

```c
typedef void (*recomp_func_t)(void);
recomp_func_t recomp_lookup(uint32_t xbox_va);        // Auto-generated dispatch table
recomp_func_t recomp_lookup_manual(uint32_t xbox_va);  // Hand-written overrides
```

The recompiler output (`tools/recomp`) generates these automatically. The xboxrecomp libraries handle everything else — memory layout, kernel calls, graphics, audio, and input.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 11/10** (D3D11 backend) — or **Linux** (OpenGL backend; `tools/linux/install_deps.sh`)
- **Python 3.10+** with `capstone` (`pip install capstone`)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (MSVC compiler)
- **CMake 3.20+**
- An original Xbox game disc image (you must own the game)

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp.git
cd xboxrecomp

# 2. Extract default.xbe from your Xbox disc image
#    (Use xdvdfs, extract-xiso, or similar tool)
mkdir game_files
# copy default.xbe and game data into game_files/

# 3. Parse the XBE — learn what you're working with
py -3 -m tools.xbe_parser game_files/default.xbe
#    Output: section map, kernel imports, entry point, XDK version

# 4. Disassemble — find all functions
py -3 -m tools.disasm game_files/default.xbe --text-only
#    Output: tools/disasm/output/ (functions.json, xrefs.json, strings.json)

# 5. Identify library functions
py -3 -m tools.func_id game_files/default.xbe -v
#    Output: tools/func_id/output/ (CRT, RenderWare, vtables classified)

# 6. Recover calling conventions and parameter counts
py -3 -m tools.abi_analysis game_files/default.xbe -v
#    Output: tools/abi_analysis/output/abi_functions.json
#    Skipping this still "works", but every function falls back to
#    cdecl / 0 params / int-or-void, so the generated signatures are guesses.

# 7. Lift to C — the big one
py -3 -m tools.recomp game_files/default.xbe --all --split 1000
#    Output: src/game/recomp/gen/ (millions of lines of C)

# 8. Set up runtime shims (see docs/runtime/ for templates)
#    - Xbox kernel replacement (152 ordinals routed)
#    - D3D8 -> D3D11 translation layer
#    - Memory layout reproduction
#    - Input system

# 9. Build and run
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
bin/your_game.exe
```

### What To Expect

The first time you run a recompiled game, **it will crash**. That's normal. The process is iterative:

1. **Boot** — get past the entry point (usually straightforward)
2. **Stub** — identify and stub out functions that touch hardware you haven't implemented yet
3. **Fix ICALLs** — indirect calls (vtable dispatches, function pointers) are the hardest 10%
4. **Add runtime** — implement kernel functions, D3D calls, and input as the game needs them
5. **Debug** — use the ICALL trace ring buffer, memory access logging, and your debugger
6. **Iterate** — each crash teaches you something about the game. Fix it and move on.

With Burnout 3 (the first game recompiled with this toolkit), the process from "empty repo" to "game boots and renders textured 3D tracks" took about two weeks of iterative development.

## How It Works

The interesting parts each have their own document rather than a summary here,
so there is one place to keep correct:

- **[The Register Model](docs/technical/register-model.md)** — why the guest
  registers are globals (and thread-local), how the guest stack is simulated,
  and why every recompiled function is `void f(void)`.
- **[Memory Layout](docs/technical/memory-layout.md)** — reproducing the Xbox
  address space with `CreateFileMapping` + 28 mirror views, and why
  `VirtualAlloc` cannot do it (mirrors must alias the same physical pages, not
  copy them).
- **[Indirect Call Dispatch](docs/technical/indirect-calls.md)** — `call [eax+0x10]`
  with no compile-time target. The hardest part of any bring-up.
- **[NV2A Shader Translation](docs/technical/nv2a-shaders.md)** — register
  combiners and vertex microcode to HLSL, both translated at runtime and cached.
- **[SEH and Exception Handling](docs/technical/seh-handling.md)** — how
  `__SEH_prolog`/`__SEH_epilog` are detected per title and bridged.

## Games That Work Well As Targets

Based on our experience with Burnout 3, the best candidates for Xbox static recomp share these traits:

| Factor | Easier | Harder |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Engine** | RenderWare (shared patterns) | Custom engine (unique quirks) |
| **Threading** | Single-threaded | Multi-threaded with sync |
| **GPU usage** | Standard D3D8 calls | NV2A push buffer microcode |
| **Code size** | Small .text section | Large with LTCG |
| **Online** | Offline only | Xbox Live dependent |
| **PC port** | No PC version (worth the effort!) | Good PC port exists |

See [docs/technical/candidate-games.md](docs/technical/candidate-games.md) for a detailed list of promising targets.

## Projects Using This Toolkit

- **[Burnout 3: Takedown](https://github.com/sp00nznet/burnout3)** — The origin title and most mature target. 22,097 functions lifted. An earlier build was playable to the main menu at 60fps, but leaned on hand-written menu and render scaffolding; that is being replaced with genuinely recompiled code, and the honest bring-up currently reaches engine/RenderWare init. Treat the old "playable" claim as retired until the recompiled path gets back there.
- **[Xbox Dashboard](https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxdashboard)** — The original Xbox system shell (build 3944). Boots and renders the green orb at 60fps (D3D8→D3D11). Its UI is driven by a **VRML97 + JavaScript scene engine** (text→bytecode compiler + stack-machine VM + node-class reflection registry) — currently being brought online; demonstrates the toolkit on system software, not just games.
- **[Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions](https://github.com/sp00nznet/wreckless)** — Xbox launch title (2002). Custom engine, 3,407 functions, boots through CRT init into game main. Debugging early gameplay crash.
- **[Blood Wake](https://github.com/sp00nznet/bloodwake)** — First-party Microsoft naval combat (2001). Stormfront Studios custom engine. 4,608 functions, 367K lines of C generated (99.1% success). Project scaffolded, working toward first build.

## How You Can Help

This is an emerging field. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Try it on a new game** — Pick an Xbox exclusive, follow the pipeline, and see how far you get. Even partial results teach us about the toolchain's gaps.
2. **Improve the lifter** — Coverage is good but unquantified; the honest signal is that an unhandled instruction lifts to a bare `/* mnemonic */` comment, so grepping generated output for those finds the gaps. Segment prefixes and the rarer x87/SSE forms are where they cluster.
3. **Document Xbox formats** — Every game has its own asset formats. Document what you discover.
4. **Build runtime components** — Better D3D8 emulation, audio, networking — the runtime layer is where most per-game work happens.
5. **Share your findings** — Write up what you learn. The Xbox modding/preservation community benefits from every discovery.

## Dependencies

The toolchain is intentionally lightweight:

```
Python 3.10+
capstone        # x86 disassembly  (pip install capstone)
pytest          # test suite only  (pip install pytest)
```

That's it for the core pipeline — no IDA, no Ghidra, no proprietary tools. Just the standard library + Capstone. (An *optional* `tools/ghidra_naming` helper can use headless Ghidra purely to recover symbol names; it is never required to produce a working build.)

### Running the tests

```
py -3 -m pytest tools/       # unit tests
py -3 -m tools.conformance   # differential: lifted C vs the real CPU
```

The unit tests are fast and need no game files. The conformance suite goes
further: it assembles each snippet with MSVC, lifts the resulting bytes, then
runs the lifted C *and the original instructions* over the same inputs and
requires them to agree. Because we target x86 and run on x86, the host CPU is
the oracle — no model to be wrong. See
[Conformance Testing](docs/technical/conformance-testing.md). It needs a 32-bit
MSVC, and is skipped rather than failed where there isn't one.

If you fix a lift, add the case.

The runtime libraries (C) use:
- MSVC (Visual Studio 2022) or MinGW-w64
- Windows SDK (D3D11, DXGI, XInput, waveOut)
- CMake 3.20+
- No external dependencies — all hardware emulation code is self-contained

## FAQ

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: This project provides tools and documentation. You must own a legitimate copy of any game you recompile. No copyrighted game code or assets are included in this repository.

**Q: How is this different from an emulator?**
A: Emulators interpret or JIT-compile code at runtime. Static recompilation translates the entire binary ahead of time into native C code that compiles to a regular `.exe`. There's no CPU emulation at runtime — the recompiled functions execute directly.

**Q: Can I use this on Xbox 360 games?**
A: No. Xbox 360 uses PowerPC (big-endian, different ISA). See [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) for Xbox 360 static recompilation. This toolkit is specifically for the original Xbox's x86 code.

**Q: How long does it take to get a game running?**
A: It depends on the game's complexity. Burnout 3 went from zero to "boots and renders 3D tracks" in about two weeks. Simple games might be faster; complex ones with custom engines could take longer. The toolchain handles the mechanical translation — the real work is building the runtime shims and debugging indirect calls.

**Q: Why C output instead of direct x86-64 binary translation?**
A: C is portable, debuggable, and the compiler optimizes it for you. You can read the output, set breakpoints in it, and modify individual functions. Direct binary translation would be faster to run but impossible to debug or modify.

The APU and the NV2A register definitions were extracted from
[xemu](https://github.com/xemu-project/xemu) and are that project's work, not

a recompiled game is unaffected; what it asks is that the notices stay, the
source stays available, and users can relink against a modified library.
[LICENSES/LGPL-2.1.txt](LICENSES/LGPL-2.1.txt) is the verbatim licence text —
shipping it alongside those files is a requirement, not a courtesy.

Not every file under `src/apu/` and `src/nv2a/` is xemu-derived. See

who never sent a patch and still moved the project further than a patch would
have, by finding the wall everyone else was about to hit.

## Changelog

Versions start at v0.1.0 with the initial public release; earlier entries were
reconstructed from the commit history, so they are dated by when the work
actually landed rather than by any tag that existed at the time.

### v0.6.0 — *"Credit Where Due"* (August 2026)

*The first release with contributors other than the maintainer, and the
housekeeping that should have been in place before there were any.*

**Correctness — the silent kind.** Every fix here produced C that compiled,
linked, ran, and was wrong, with no lifter warning anywhere.

- **Conditional tail calls skipped the frame bridge** — `jcc` to a known
  function entry is a tail call, but only the unconditional form emitted the
  bridge, so the taken edge ran with the caller's frame still live. 8,263 call
  sites across 5,426 functions on the title tested — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#7)
- **Indirect calls read their target after the return-address push**, so
  `call [esp+X]` resolved from the wrong slot — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#7)
- **`repe cmpsb` / `repne scasb` folded their flags to a literal 1**, so every
  `memcmp`/`strcmp`-shaped loop in the CRT reported "equal" regardless of
  input — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#8)
- **`NEG` carry was dropped before a non-adjacent `SBB`/`ADC`**, which is the
  standard 64-bit subtract and sign-extend idiom — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#8)
- **Signed compares evaluated at 32 bits regardless of operand width**, so the
  sign bit of an 8- or 16-bit operand was never in the right place — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#8)
- **Packed SSE was lifted as a scalar `float`** — `movaps`/`movups` moved 4 of
  16 bytes and dropped the upper three lanes (18,439 moves), and packed
  arithmetic had no pattern at all (561 operations dropped) — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#9)
- **904 x87 instructions across 28 mnemonics lifted to comments**, desynchro-
  nising the FPU stack from that point on; `FNSTCW`/`FNSTSW` were comments too,
  so every `fcom`-derived parity test read a hardcoded `true` (1,326 sites) — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#9)
- **XMM was a function-local**, so a value written in one lifted block and read
  in the next was lost — *[@NoRain211](https://github.com/NoRain211)* (#10)

**Pipeline**

- **`tools/abi_analysis` now exists.** `tools.recomp` had always looked for
  `abi_functions.json`, warned when it was missing, and then fallen back to
  cdecl / 0 params / int-or-void for *every* function — because the tool meant
  to produce that file was never written. Recovers calling convention
  (including thiscall), parameter count from the `ret` immediate, return-type
  hints and frame shape — *[@DarthSidious666](https://github.com/DarthSidious666)* (#6)
- **The SSE runtime.** The lift in #9/#10 emitted 28 `XMM_*` helpers that
  nothing defined. Added `RecompXmm` plus lane-wise implementations, verified by
  compiling real lifter output under MSVC and checking the cases where x86
  disagrees with naive C — `MINPS` returning its second operand on a tie,
  `ANDNPS` being `~dst & src`, `CMPNEQPS` being the unordered form.
- **The research branch merged back**: per-title SEH detection, the
  function-boundary fix, operand-aware x87, the MS Ficl/Fission study, XISO
  redump support, and indirect-call feedback.

**Project**

- **[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md)** — including the people who only ever
  filed an issue. [@Tiptup300](https://github.com/Tiptup300) (#1) found that
  every documented getting-started step was broken, on Linux; that report is why
  the pipeline was fixed *and* why this repository has a LICENSE file at all.
  [@M0RSM4LLEO](https://github.com/M0RSM4LLEO) (#2) reproduced it with the
  detail that made it actionable.
- **LGPL compliance.** The xemu-derived APU and NV2A sources always carried
  their notices, but the repository shipped no `NOTICE` and no copy of the
  licence. Both now present, with every affected file listed against the
  copyright it actually carries.
- **The test suite actually runs.** A bare import in `tools/symbols` aborted
  pytest collection for the whole tree, so `pytest tools/` executed nothing.
  Now 141 tests.
- **Differential conformance testing** (`tools/conformance`) — assembles each
  snippet with MSVC, lifts the bytes, and runs the lifted C against the original
  instructions on the real CPU over 1,560 input vectors. Adapted from
  ps3recomp's methodology, but stronger here: it targets x86 and runs on x86, so
  the oracle is the hardware rather than a model of it. Found `stc`/`clc`/`cmc`
  unimplemented — the carry a following `adc`/`sbb` read kept whatever the last
  arithmetic left in it.

### v0.5.0 — *"Fall-Through"* (July 2026)

- **Fall-through into the next function was dropped.** When the disassembler
  splits a straight-line run of code at an internal branch target, the earlier
  function often ends by falling through into the next — which x86 executes. The
  lifter emitted nothing, so the body ended and skipped the next function's
  shared epilogue: an esp leak that corrupted callee-saved registers.
  **4,587 of 35,286 functions in Burnout 3** had this shape.
- **Per-title SEH detection.** `__SEH_prolog`/`__SEH_epilog` addresses were
  hardcoded to one game's CRT, so on every other title the `ebp` read-back was
  never emitted. Found by signature now.
- Halo bring-up: debug-build symbol recovery, per-target memory map, x87
  correctness, and seven misrouted kernel ordinals.

### v0.4.0 — *"Portable"* (May 2026)

- **Cross-platform layer with an OpenGL D3D8 backend** beside the Windows D3D11
  path, POSIX path handling, and Linux build deps. Builds with GCC/Clang.
- **`ghidra_naming` (optional)** — headless Ghidra FidDb pass recovers real
  CRT/XDK symbol names from a stripped XBE. The core pipeline still needs no
  disassembler.

### v0.3.0 — *"Fixed Function"* (March 2026)

- **Full multi-texture fixed-function pipeline** — 4-stage blending with all
  D3D8 operations and full `D3DTA` argument resolution, 4 samplers per draw.
- **Hardware T&L lighting** — up to 8 lights with materials, global ambient,
  specular, and world-space normal transform; Blinn-Phong with attenuation and
  spotlight cones.
- **Vertex fog** (linear/exp/exp2) and a **4MB DrawPrimitiveUP ring buffer**
  that removes per-call buffer create/destroy.
- **`--seed-functions`** for iterative disassembly on stripped binaries.

### v0.2.0 — *"Programmable"* (March 2026)

- **NV2A register combiner pixel shaders** — full 8-stage plus final combiner
  translated to HLSL at runtime, with a 128-entry cache.
- **NV2A programmable vertex shaders** — 128-bit microcode parser and HLSL
  generator covering all 14 MAC and 8 ILU operations, 192 constant registers,
  and relative addressing.
- **Texture unswizzling** — Xbox Z-order (Morton) to linear.
- **NV2A PGRAPH → D3D11 translator**, push buffer method interception.
- **EEPROM / AV pack / SMBus** so games can query region, language, video
  standard and hardware info.

### v0.1.0 — *"First Light"* (March 2026)

Initial public release: XBE parser, x86 disassembler and function detector,
library-function identifier, the x86 → C recompiler, and the runtime libraries
(kernel, D3D8, DirectSound, APU, NV2A, input), extracted from the Burnout 3
bring-up that started it.
