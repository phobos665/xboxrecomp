/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

 *   target 0x41B0B870 -- 1 time(s) (total calls: 6930990)
 *
 * -- two threads' reports spliced together, with a caller list that stops
 * mid-sentence and an address that belongs to neither line as read. These
 * diagnostics exist to be read during exactly the multi-threaded bring-up
 * that breaks them.
 *
 * The CRT exposes the lock these calls were already taking one at a time, so
 * hold it across the whole report instead. */

/* ── Forza's small-object pool: pages that own their 64 KB window ──
 *
 * operator delete (sub_00059560) tells a pool slot from a CRT heap block by
 * one bit per 64 KB region: the bitmap at 0x589340, indexed ptr >> 16. That is
 * exact on the console, where every VirtualAlloc region starts on a 64 KB
 * boundary, and the pool takes each page with its own one-page VirtualAlloc
 * (sub_0027D020). Here regions are 4 KB apart, so fifteen pool pages and the
 * tail of the process heap shared a window: releasing one page cleared the
 * bit for all of them, deletes of live slots went to RtlFreeHeap 8 bytes off
 * a block, and the heap was corrupt by the race load. Giving every region a
 * 64 KB window instead (RECOMP_VA_64K) cures it and runs the 64 MB guest out
 * of memory, because a window here is real memory, not address space.
 *
 * So the pool gets windows of its own. These replace the two functions that
 * take and give back a pool page and set or clear its bit: pages come from
 * 64 KB-aligned chunks that hold nothing but pool pages, sixteen to a window,
 * and the window's bit is cleared only when its last page goes back. The bit
 * then means exactly what delete takes it to mean, at no cost in memory.
 * Pages are reused rather than released; the pool asks MEM_NOZERO anyway. */

     * right for both conventions, and guessing failure would break the
     * callers for which zero is correct. What can be fixed is the silence.
