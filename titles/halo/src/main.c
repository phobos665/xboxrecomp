/**
 * Halo - Recompiled Game Entry Point
 *
 * This is the executable that hosts the recompiled game code, on Windows,
 * macOS and Linux. It performs the following initialization sequence:
 *
 * 1. Load the original XBE file from disk
 * 2. Initialize the Xbox memory layout (map data sections to original VAs)
 * 3. Initialize the Xbox kernel replacement layer
 * 4. Initialize the kernel bridge (thunk table in Xbox memory)
 * 5. Set up game file paths for I/O redirection
 * 6. Initialize the stack pointer
 * 7. Install the fault handler (a VEH on Windows, signals on POSIX)
 * 8. Call the game's original entry point (recompiled)
 *
 * Customize this file for your game:
 *   - Set YOUR_GAME_ENTRY_POINT to the XBE entry point address
 *   - Set YOUR_GAME_XBE_PATH to where the XBE file lives
 *   - Set YOUR_GAME_DIR to the game data directory
 *   - Add any CRT global pre-initialization your game needs
 *   - Customize the crash report (title_crash) for game-specific diagnosis
 *
 * What is not portable C -- where the executable is, where the output goes,
 * message boxes, symbol names, the fault handler, and on POSIX which thread
 * the title runs on -- is in the runtime (src/platform/host_main.h,
 * src/platform/recomp_fault.h), not here.
 *
 * XBE Details (fill in from xbe_parser output):
 *   Title:       Halo
 *   Title ID:    0x00000000
 *   Base addr:   0x00010000
 *   Entry point: 0x00000000
 *   Code size:   ~??? KB (.text)
 *   Sections:    ?? (list them)
 *   Kernel imports: ??

/*
 * The runtime catches every host fault (src/platform/recomp_fault.h) and

 * faults that are meant to happen, and title_crash, the report for the rest.
 *
 * When the recompiled game hits an access violation, the report prints
 * the faulting address, all Xbox register values, and a native stack trace.
 * This is your primary debugging tool during bring-up.
 *
 * Customize this for your game:
 *   - Add game-specific address checks (GPU register probes, etc.)
 *   - Add dumps of game-specific globals (heap handles, state flags)
 *   - Add SEH simulation if your game uses __try/__except
 */
/* Name the guest function a fault happened in, and recover the call chain.
 *
 * Recompiled code faults as ordinary native code, so the fault carries a
 * host program counter and nothing else -- there is no guest program counter
 * to report, and the host address changes every build. Two things recover
 * the guest view:
 *
 *   - every generated function is a real symbol in the image (sub_005A03C0
 *     and so on), so the symbols already map host address back to guest
 *     function: host_symbol_name turns an anonymous pc into that name
 *     (dbghelp and the .pdb beside the .exe on Windows, dladdr elsewhere).
 *
 *   - every lifted call pushes its guest return address onto the guest stack
 *     before jumping, so the stack still holds the chain. Scanning up from esp
 *     for values inside the code sections recovers it.
 *
 * ponytail: the stack scan is a scan, not a frame walk -- these are FPO frames
 * with no reliable ebp chain, so there is nothing to walk. It over-reports,
 * since addresses from returned-from calls linger below esp, but naming the
 * guest function is the whole question at a fault.
