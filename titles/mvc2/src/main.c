/**
 * Marvel vs Capcom 2 - Recompiled Game Entry Point
 *
 * This is the Windows executable that hosts the recompiled game code.
 * It performs the following initialization sequence:
 *
 * 1. Load the original XBE file from disk
 * 2. Initialize the Xbox memory layout (map data sections to original VAs)
 * 3. Initialize the Xbox kernel replacement layer
 * 4. Initialize the kernel bridge (thunk table in Xbox memory)
 * 5. Set up game file paths for I/O redirection
 * 6. Initialize the stack pointer
 * 7. Install VEH crash handler for diagnostics
 * 8. Call the game's original entry point (recompiled)
 *
 * Customize this file for your game:
 *   - Set YOUR_GAME_ENTRY_POINT to the XBE entry point address
 *   - Set YOUR_GAME_XBE_PATH to where the XBE file lives
 *   - Set YOUR_GAME_DIR to the game data directory
 *   - Add any CRT global pre-initialization your game needs
 *   - Customize the VEH handler for game-specific crash diagnosis
 *
 * XBE Details (fill in from xbe_parser output):
 *   Title:       Marvel vs Capcom 2
 *   Title ID:    0x00000000
 *   Base addr:   0x00010000
 *   Entry point: 0x00000000

/* Name the guest function a fault happened in, and recover the call chain.
 *
 * Recompiled code faults as ordinary native code, so the exception record
 * carries a host RIP and nothing else -- there is no guest program counter to
 * report, and the host address changes every build. Two things recover the
 * guest view:
 *
 *   - every generated function is a real symbol in the image (sub_005A03C0
 *     and so on), so the linker's PDB already maps host address back to guest
 *     function. dbghelp turns an anonymous RIP into that name.
 *
 *   - every lifted call pushes its guest return address onto the guest stack
 *     before jumping, so the stack still holds the chain. Scanning up from esp
 *     for values inside the code sections recovers it.
 *
 * ponytail: the stack scan is a scan, not a frame walk -- these are FPO frames
 * with no reliable ebp chain, so there is nothing to walk. It over-reports,
 * since addresses from returned-from calls linger below esp, but naming the
 * guest function is the whole question at a fault.
 *
 * Requires linking dbghelp and keeping the .pdb beside the .exe.
