/*
 * Indirect-branch target feedback.
 *
 * Records which guest addresses the title actually reaches through indirect
 * branches, so the next codegen run can seed function detection with them
 * instead of guessing. This is the local equivalent of the two inputs
 * Microsoft's own recompiler takes -- VirtualDispatchTraceFiles (recorded
 * indirect-branch target sets) and UpdateEnlightenments (a persisted analysis
 * database the compiler rewrites every build). See
 * docs/technical/ms-fusion-codegen-teardown.md.
 *
 * Static analysis cannot see where a vtable call goes. Running the title can.
 * tools/recomp/analyze_unresolved.py currently classifies unresolved targets by
 * where they land relative to known functions, which is inference; this is
 * measurement.
 *
 * Opt-in: define RECOMP_ICALL_FEEDBACK. Without it this file compiles to
 * nothing and the RECOMP_ICALL_OBSERVE hook in recomp_types.h expands to
 * (void)0, so release builds pay neither the store nor the 8 MiB.
 *
 * Cost when enabled: one byte OR per indirect branch, into a flat array indexed
 * by guest VA. A byte array rather than a bitmap because a byte store needs no
 * read-modify-write, so concurrent recompiled threads cannot lose each other's
 * writes -- and 8 MiB is not worth a CAS loop. Dedup is free: the same target
 * hit a million times is still one byte.
