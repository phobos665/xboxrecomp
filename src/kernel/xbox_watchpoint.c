/**
 * Guest memory watchpoints.
 *
 * Every hard bug in this project so far has come down to the same question:
 * *what wrote this?* A structure holds a value it should not, the code walks
 * into it and faults, and the fault tells you where the damage was read, not
 * where it was done. TimeSplitters 2's dark level, Marvel vs Capcom 2's
 * stalled frame loop and Outrun 2's wild pointer were all that shape.
 *
 * There is already a watch of a sort: RECOMP_WATCH_VA in recomp_trace.c polls
 * an address at every function entry. It has two limits that matter. It needs
 * a --trace-all-entries build, which costs a few percent of frame time and
 * has to be lifted specially; and it can only say "it changed somewhere
 * between entering A and entering B", which on a hot path is thousands of
 * instructions of suspects.
 *
 * This is the exact version, and it works in a plain build. It protects the
 * page, lets the write fault, and names the instruction:
 *
 *     RECOMP_WATCH_WRITE=0x001A5F0C:4 titles/outrun2/.../outrun2_recomp.exe
 *
 *     [WATCH] write to 0x001A5F0C from sub_001BB69D+0x2A
 *     [WATCH]   0x00000000 -> 0xF8604020
 *     [WATCH]   guest esp=0x00F7EF2C eax=0xF8604020 ecx=0x001A5F08
 *     [WATCH]   callers: 0x001BC6D2 <- 0x001BD546 <- 0x001BD668
 *
 * How it works: the watched page is made read-only, so a write to it raises
 * an access violation. The handler reports it, restores the page, and sets
 * the processor's trap flag so the very next instruction raises a
 * single-step exception -- at which point the write has happened, the new
 * value can be read, and the page is protected again.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing:
 *
 *   - Protection is per page and per process, so a watch on one word traps
 *     every write to the 4 KB around it, and during the one-instruction
 *     window when the page is restored another thread's write to it is
 *     missed. Guest code is cooperatively single-threaded here, so in
 *     practice that window is the vblank thread and the ISR.
 *
 *   - Mirror regions are separate mappings of the same memory, so a write
 *     through a different alias of the same physical page does not trap.
 *     Watch the address the writer actually uses.
 *
 * The companion is RECOMP_FIND_VALUE, which scans guest RAM for a value and
 * prints every address holding it. That is how you get an address to watch
 * when all you have is a bad pointer: find who is holding it, then watch that
 * field and re-run. The two together turn "it crashed on garbage" into a
 * named function in two runs, provided the failure is deterministic.
