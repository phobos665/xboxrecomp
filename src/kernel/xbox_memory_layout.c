/**
 * Xbox Memory Layout Implementation
 *
 * Maps the XBE data sections to their expected virtual addresses on Windows.
 * This is critical for the recompiled code which references globals by
 * absolute address (e.g., mov eax, [0x004D532C]).
 *
 * Implementation:
 * 1. VirtualAlloc a contiguous region at XBOX_BASE_ADDRESS
 * 2. Copy .rdata and initialized .data from the XBE
 * 3. Zero-fill the BSS region
 * 4. Set memory protection (read-only for .rdata)

/* The flip gate (xbox_memory_layout.h).
 *
 * The HLE Swap calls xbox_Nv2aFlipGateArm() before it runs the title's own
 * Swap, and that call sleeps until the kernel's vblank tick releases it. So
 * there is one Swap per vblank, the guest thread sleeps for the rest of the
 * frame instead of spinning, and the title's own fence wait is not involved.
 *
 * It is not involved on purpose. The first version held the fence mirror
 * instead, so that the title's wait inside Swap would block; but a title
 * waits for the *previous* frame's fence there (its flips are double
 * buffered), which the mirror had already completed at the last vblank, and
 * two Swaps got through per vblank: TimeSplitters 2's menus measured 120-140
 * fps with a 60 Hz vblank.
 *
 * The gate only holds once a vblank has ever been delivered -- without
 * RECOMP_VBLANK nothing would release it -- and never for more than a quarter
 * of a second, so a vblank thread that stops cannot hang the title; the first
 * timeout is logged, because it means pacing is not happening. A vblank that
 * arrived while the title was still drawing does not count: the wait is for
 * the next one, or the frame after it could present again in the same period.
 *
 * Adaptive by default: a Swap that arrives after the vblank it should have
 * waited for presents at once, and only a frame that finished inside the
 * period is held for the next vblank. RECOMP_FPS_CAP=<fps> is the strict
 * console cadence instead -- every Swap waits for the next release, and the
 * release comes every (vblank rate / fps)th vblank; 30 with a 60 Hz vblank
 * is what a title sees on hardware when it misses every other frame, fine
 * for a fixed-30 title and half speed for one that steps its logic per
 * presented frame. RECOMP_FPS_CAP=0 switches the gate off, for measuring.
 *
 * Why adaptive won (TimeSplitters 2's Siberia, 19 Sep 2026, quiet machine,
 * three scripted runs of each, docs/technical/resolution-and-framerate.md):
 * uncapped the level ran 79-89 fps with a 12.4 ms frame, so the title was
 * not paced at all; adaptive held 59.9-60.2 in every five-second window with
 * 3.7 ms of gate wait per frame; strict 60 held 60 most of the time but
 * dipped to 55-58 and once to 45 at the same points in all three runs,
 * because a frame that just misses its vblank waits out a whole extra one.
 * Burnout 2's front end, 1 ms of work a frame, holds 60.0 under either. */

 * the semaphore for it in two steps, or checks a count and then sleeps on
 * it, trusting that nothing runs in between unless it blocks or its quantum
 * ends. Run on several host cores at once, other guest threads land in those
 * gaps all the time: Outrun 2 hung on its AM2 logo in 4 of 4 runs, a task
 * finishing between "is it still running?" and "here is your semaphore".
 * Host threads (the renderer, audio, the window) are left free.
 *
 * 1 picks a core for the guest: the highest-numbered core of the fastest
 * class the process may run on. A number above 1 is taken as a core index
 * + 1 (2 = core 1, ...). Off when unset or 0.
 *
 * "The fastest class" matters on a hybrid CPU. Windows numbers the
 * efficiency cores last, so "the highest core" on an i7-12700H was CPU 19,
 * an E-core, and the whole title -- lifted code, HLE, renderer submission --
 * ran on it: Outrun 2's race measured 12-15 fps there and 35-40 fps on a
 * P-core, the same build, the same drive (1 Oct 2026). CPU sets report each
 * logical processor's EfficiencyClass (higher is faster); the pick is the
 * highest-numbered processor of the highest class, which also keeps the

 * The mutex under the lock is not fair (Darwin's pthread mutex and Windows'
 * CRITICAL_SECTION both let the releasing thread take it straight back), and
 * a guest thread only lets go at a kernel call. So a thread that loops on
 * kernel calls (BLiNX enters and leaves a critical section 160,000 times
 * waiting for its loader) re-wins the lock every time, and one that spins in
 * lifted code without any (BLiNX again, polling an I/O port) never lets go at
 * all: with the lock on, BLiNX never reached its first Swap.
 *
 * The console's answer is preemption: a thread's quantum ends. The answer
 * here is the same at the two places a guest thread can let go -- coming back
 * from a kernel call (xbox_GuestLockRestore), and at a loop's back edge in
 * lifted code (RECOMP_BACKEDGE, emitted by the lifter at every loop header):
 * when another thread is waiting and this one has held the lock for its
 * quantum, it hands the lock over and waits its turn.
 *
 * g_guest_lock_waiters counts threads blocked on the lock, guest or host; it
 * is the one thing a back edge reads, a plain (not thread-local) volatile, so
 * the common case costs a load and a predicted branch, and the compiler
 * cannot hoist it out of a loop. g_guest_takes counts acquisitions, so a
 * thread handing over can tell when someone else has run.
 *
 *   RECOMP_GUEST_QUANTUM_US=<us>  the quantum (2000)
 *
 * Handoffs and host waits are counted and printed every five seconds while
 * they happen ([GUESTLOCK] lines). */

/* Priority, as the console's scheduler weighs it: strict.
 *
 * The lock belongs to the highest-priority runnable guest thread. The holder
 * keeps it until it blocks (a blocking kernel call, xbox_GuestSleep) or
 * suspends itself; a waiter of higher priority takes it at the holder's next
 * back edge -- the only preemption point lifted code has -- or when the
 * holder blocks; an equal one at a back edge or blocking call once the
 * holder's quantum is up; a lower one only when the holder blocks (or past
 * the starvation valve, GL_STARVE_QUANTA, which says so). A kernel call that
 * cannot block is NOT a preemption point (xbox_GuestLockDropForKernel), and a
 * free lock goes to the highest waiter (guest_outranked). A host thread
 * waiting (an interrupt) outranks every guest thread and preempts anywhere a
 * guest thread lets go, a non-blocking kernel call included.
 * docs/technical/memory-layout.md, "Guest threads", has the reasons, all of
 * them from BLiNX's CRI ADX lock. BLiNX's lowest thread is an idle counter
 * (MEM32(0x414ACC)++ until a flag is set) that on the console runs only when
 * nothing else can.
 *
 * Guest priorities come from KeSetBasePriorityThread / KeSetPriorityThread,
 * resolved by the bridge to the thread they name (xbox_GuestLockNotePriority,
 * by host thread id: the object a title passes is often the one shared
 * pseudo-handle object for "the current thread", so it names nobody); 0
 * until set. A title commonly sets a thread's priority before it first runs,
 * so the table is keyed by id, not by the thread's own record. */

 * calling NtResumeThread is not preempted by one at 1.
 *
 * Titles depend on that. BLiNX's movie library (CRI ADX) locks by raising its
 * own priority to 16 and resuming a priority-2 spinner, then counts the lock:
 *   if (count == 0) { save prio; SetThreadPriority(self, 16); ResumeThread(spinner); }
 *   count++;
 * Seven kernel calls between the test and the increment, each a handoff
 * point, so its file-server thread got in between and both took the lock.
 * The spinner's suspend count ended at 2 (it never ran again), the server
 * thread inherited the main thread's saved priority, and the second movie
 * never issued a read.
 *
 * So a call the bridge knows cannot block leaves a reservation while the lock
 * is down: other guest threads wait for it to come back (they count as
 * waiters, so the holder hands over at its next back edge, by priority, as
 * before). Host threads -- interrupts -- ignore it, as do the caller's own
 * callbacks. It lapses after RECOMP_GUEST_RESERVE_US (50000) in case a call
 * blocks after all -- the bound is for a blocking call missing from the
 * bridge's list, and is generous because a slow host must not break the rule:
 * at 1 ms, a loaded Mac (and the [THREADS] trace's own writes) let BLiNX's
 * server in a few times a second. An ordinal that overruns it is named once.
 * 0 switches the reservation off. */

     * of the form `cmp byte [ecx], 0` read whatever happened to be at 0 and
     * decided the pointer was fine, and a store through a null pointer landed
     * on real memory and surfaced as corruption somewhere unrelated. Faulting
     * here turns both into one access violation at the instruction that made
     * the mistake, which the crash handler can name.
     *
     * Opt-in through RECOMP_TRAP_NULL, because it converts a class of bug the
     * title currently survives into a hard stop: a guest that dereferences null
     * and ignores the result keeps running while page zero reads as zero, and
     * stops dead once it faults. That is the right default for hunting one of
     * these and the wrong one for making progress past the rest, so it is a
     * switch rather than a policy.
     *
     * Note this is separate from moving the TIB off page zero, which is not
     * optional: with the TIB gone, address 0 reads as plain zero, so a null
     * check written as a load through the pointer now gets the answer it
     * expects whether or not the page is trapped.
