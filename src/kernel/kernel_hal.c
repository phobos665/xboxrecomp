 * IRQL Simulation
 *
 * Xbox uses IRQL (Interrupt Request Level) for synchronization:
 *   PASSIVE_LEVEL (0) - normal thread execution
 *   APC_LEVEL (1) - APC delivery
 *   DISPATCH_LEVEL (2) - scheduler/DPC level, no page faults allowed
 *
 * On Windows, we simulate IRQL with a thread-local variable. Raising to
 * DISPATCH_LEVEL doesn't actually prevent preemption, but the tracking
 * allows code that checks IRQL to function correctly.
 * ============================================================================ */

/* DISPATCH_LEVEL, for the whole processor.
 *
 * The Xbox has one CPU. A thread that raises to DISPATCH_LEVEL stops the
 * scheduler, every other thread and every DPC until it lowers again, and
 * titles rely on exactly that as a lock. With the level kept per thread,
 * nothing was excluded. Marvel vs Capcom 2's ADX sound thread runs its server
 * at DISPATCH_LEVEL while its main thread edits the same stream buffers at
 * PASSIVE_LEVEL, and a watchpoint saw both threads write one ring buffer's
 * positions. That is the hazard; no failure has been traced to it yet.
 *
 * So crossing into DISPATCH_LEVEL takes one recursive host lock and parks
 * the other guest threads at their next bridge boundary
 * (xbox_DispatchParkOthers, xbox_memory_layout.c); lowering below it releases
 * both. The timer thread holds the lock while it runs DPCs
 * (xbox_DispatchLockEnterTimed). Interrupt service routines are not held
 * off: on hardware they arrive above DISPATCH_LEVEL.
 *
 * Off by default: RECOMP_DISPATCH_LOCK=1 turns it on. Measured on MvC2 it
 * did not change the fight freeze (a disassembly miss, since seeded), and it
 * changes threading for every title, so it waits for a title that needs it. */

 * console's KeQueryPerformanceFrequency returns, so a title is free to skip
 * asking and write the constant into its own arithmetic -- and titles do.
 *
 * This used to hand back Win32's counter and Win32's frequency unchanged.
 * That is self-consistent, so a title that asks for both computes correct
 * durations and nothing looks wrong; Burnout 2 and TimeSplitters 2 both do
 * that and both work. A title that assumes the console's rate instead gets
 * every duration scaled by whatever this machine's QPC happens to run at --
 * typically 10 MHz, so just under three times too fast. Tony Hawk's Pro
 * Skater 2X calls ordinal 126 ninety-four million times in seventy seconds
 * and ordinal 127 not once, which is what "it hard-codes the frequency"
 * looks like from outside.
 *
 * So scale the host counter to the console's rate and report the console's
 * rate. Both kinds of title are then right, and the two answers still agree
 * with each other, which is the property the old code had and the only one
 * worth keeping.
 *
 * The scaling is done on the difference from a base captured at start-up,
 * not on the raw QPC value: QPC counts from boot, and 64-bit ticks times
 * 3,375,000 overflows about twenty minutes after the host was switched on.
