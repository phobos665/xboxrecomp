/* Where a title spends its calls.
 *
 * A recompiled title that is CPU-bound gives no clue which guest code is
 * responsible: the native profile is a wall of sub_XXXX, and the guest has no
 * program counter to sample. Counting entries does answer it, and the trace
 * hook is already on every function the run was generated to trace -- so
 * tracing everything and tallying instead of printing turns the existing
 * mechanism into a profile for the cost of an array increment.
 *
 * Counts, not time: a function called once that loops for a minute does not
 * appear here, and one called ten million times cheaply does. It says where
 * the calls go, which is the first question, not the last.
 *
 * Enable with RECOMP_TRACE_PROFILE=1. The report goes to stderr at exit,
 * hottest first.
 *
 * The stderr report shows the top 40 only, which answers "where do the calls
 * go" but cannot answer "did this particular function ever run" -- and that
 * second question is the one bring-up actually asks, because a function that
 * should have initialised something and did not is invisible in a top-40 list
 * of 25,000 entered functions. Reading absence out of that list is a mistake
 * that looks like evidence. Set RECOMP_PROFILE_DUMP to a path to get the
 * whole table instead, rewritten at every report so a run that faults still
 * leaves a complete one behind.
 *
 * The report only fires every N calls, so the table on disk lags the run by up
 * to N entries -- which is exactly the window a crash lands in. Reading "this
 * function is absent, so it never ran" off a lagging table is wrong in the one
 * case that matters. The crash handler calls this directly so the file covers
 * the fault itself; absence in a file written that way is real.
