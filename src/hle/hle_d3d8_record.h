/*
 * hle_d3d8_record.h -- the host boundary of shadow mode, and frame capture
 * recorded at it.
 *
 * Every call src/hle makes into the host renderer (src/d3d) goes through one
 * of the wrappers below. Each one forwards the call unchanged and, while a
 * frame is being captured, also writes it into the capture
 * (d3d8_capture.h). Because the wrappers sit after all of shadow mode's Xbox
 * conversion, a capture holds exactly what the host was given, and replay
 * (src/replay) needs no Xbox knowledge to reproduce it.
 *
 * The rule that keeps this true: nothing in src/hle calls a device vtable
 * entry or a d3d8_vsh_* / d3d8_combiners_* setter directly. A direct call is
 * a call the capture cannot see, and a replay that silently differs from the
 * run. The one exception is reading the back buffer for frame dumps
 * (hle_d3d8.c, shadow_dump_frame), which changes no state.
 *
 * Cost when not capturing: one test of a static pointer per call.
 *
 *   RECOMP_D3D8_CAPTURE=<path>     where to write; capture is off without it
 *   RECOMP_D3D8_CAPTURE_SWAP=<n>   which swap to record (default 120)
 *   RECOMP_D3D8_CAPTURE_EVERY=<n>  then one more every n swaps (n >= 2), to
 *                                  <path>_<swap>.d3dcap, at most 24 files
 *   RECOMP_D3D8_CAPTURE_MINDRAWS=<n>  keep a frame only if it drew at least n
 *                                  times; otherwise try the next swap. Every
 *                                  frame is recorded (a full snapshot each)
 *                                  and deleted while it looks, so it is slow,
 *                                  but it finds a title's rare 3D frames
 *
 * Threads: guest threads are host threads, and the wrappers take no lock.
 * That is no worse than the host renderer itself, which takes none either;
 * shadow mode's calls arrive from whichever guest thread draws. A title that
 * draws from two threads at once would interleave its chunks in the capture
 * in the order the calls happened to be made.
 *
 * Windows only, like the rest of shadow mode.

 * push buffer the GPU consumes later, so a title may write a texture after
 * queueing the draw that samples it and still be correct on the console.
 * Marvel vs Capcom 2 writes each fighter's new animation tiles that way, and
 * drawing at the call showed the previous pose's tiles for one frame.
 *
 * State and draw calls below are queued with copies of what they point at.

 * whose effect depends on guest memory at execution time -- binding a guest
