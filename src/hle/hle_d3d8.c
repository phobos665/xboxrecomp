/*
 * hle_d3d8.c -- Direct3D 8 functions replaced by name.
 *
 * The route the DOAXBV port proved: replace D3D8 at its API and translate to
 * the host's graphics API, rather than emulate the NV2A beneath it. Measured
 * for Burnout 2 by tools/hle_audit/device_refs.py: no game code reads the
 * D3D device global itself -- 118 references, all inside the D3D section --
 * but two game functions fill their own push buffers through BeginPush
 * (call sites 0x000FA0D9 and 0x000FBE46), and those bypass any replacement
 * made here.
 *
 * The display-filter setters come first because their correct behaviour on a
 * PC is to do nothing: they tune the TV encoder's flicker filter, which a
 * monitor does not have.
 *
 * Shadow mode, RECOMP_HLE_D3D8=shadow
 *
 * The step toward drawing through the host renderer. Every replacement below
 * runs the title's own lifted body first (HLE_ORIGINAL), so the guest device,
 * the push buffer and every frame the executor draws stay exactly as they
 * were. Then, with the switch set, the same call is repeated on a host D3D11
 * device in a window of its own. Registers and return values are the
 * original's, so the title sees no difference. Without the switch these
 * replacements only run the originals.
 *
 * What reaches the host device so far:
 *   - CreateDevice (size), Clear, Swap;
 *   - vertex shaders: FVF codes as they are, and programs the title created,
 *     replayed from their microcode;
 *   - SetTransform, SetViewport;
 *   - DrawVerticesUP and DrawIndexedVerticesUP, the draws whose vertices the
 *     title hands over directly. In a profiled first minute of Burnout 2
 *     these were 29,087 of 36,275 draws; the rest go through vertex buffers;
 *   - SetTexture, in hle_d3d8_texture.c;
 *   - render and texture stage states, in hle_d3d8_state.c;
 *   - SetStreamSource, DrawVertices and DrawIndexedVertices, the vertex
 *     buffer draws, and the vertex shader constants, in hle_d3d8_vertex.c.
 * Draws under a vertex program use the declaration the XDK parsed into the
 * shader object (shadow_read_declaration), with NORMPACKED3 normals unpacked
 * on the CPU and the XDK's screen-space transform undone on the host (see
 * "viewports"). A program whose declaration the host cannot lay out is
 * counted and skipped, and so are draws under a declaration-only shader.
 *
 * Every call into the host renderer goes through the wrappers in
 * hle_d3d8_record.c (host_*), which is also where a frame capture is
 * recorded (RECOMP_D3D8_CAPTURE); see hle_d3d8_record.h.
 *
 * RECOMP_HLE_D3D8_DUMP=<prefix> writes the host frame to <prefix>NNN.bmp
 * every RECOMP_HLE_D3D8_DUMP_EVERY swaps (default 300), at most 24 files --
 * the same format as the executor's RECOMP_FB_DUMP, to put them side by side.
 *
 * Two host facts shape it:
 *   - Guest threads are real host threads. DXGI's Present sends messages to
 *     the window's thread and waits for them, so the window gets a thread of
 *     its own that does nothing but pump it.
 *   - The host D3D8 device is one process-wide object. The host FMV player
 *     (RECOMP_FMV_HOST) creates it too, so the two switches exclude each
 *     other.
 *
 * Each logs its first call, so a run shows the replacement was reached.

 * GPU's interrupt writes it. D3D_BlockOnTime(time) spins until that word
 * catches up, and D3D_KickOffAndWaitForIdle, BlockOnFence, BlockOnResource
 * and Swap all wait through it. Nothing here raises that interrupt, so the
 * word never moves and the first wait is the last thing the title does:
 * TimeSplitters 2 stopped after its first Swap, 270 functions in, with the
 * ISR still ticking.
 *
 * The kernel's fence mirror is the answer -- it copies the device's
 * submitted value onto the completed word every poll, the same
 * acknowledgement DMA_GET = DMA_PUT makes for the FIFO. It needs the two
 * device offsets, and those move between XDK builds (5344: +0x2C submitted,
 * +0x30 pointer to completed; 4721: +0x30 and +0x34). Rather than a table by
 * XDK version, read them from D3D_BlockOnTime's own prologue, which is the
 * one place they are certainly right for this title:
 *
 *     8B 3D <g_pDevice> mov  edi, [D3D_g_pDevice]
 *     8B 47 <A>         mov  eax, [edi + A]     ; pointer to the completed word

 *     8B 47 <B>         mov  eax, [edi + B]     ; last submitted value
 *
 * Which register holds the device varies. 5344 and 4721 load it into esi
 * first thing; 4134 (Jet Set Radio Future) puts the `time` argument in esi
 * and the device in edi, so the same three reads are 8B 47 rather than
 * 8B 46. The scan below therefore looks for the load of D3D_g_pDevice
 * wherever it sits in the prologue, takes the register from its ModRM, and
 * reads A and B against that -- which also rejects a prologue reading some
 * other global without a separate check. A build laid out differently still
 * gets a line saying so and no mirror, which is the hang this replaces,
 * not a wrong write.

 * frames really have been drawn, by the host, by the time Present returns.
 *
 * The offsets are read from the title's own code rather than tabulated,

 * work on the next XDK without a new table entry. xbox_Nv2aMirrorCounter

 *

 *   - the host back buffer, for the surface the XDK itself set during
 *     CreateDevice (or, if it set none, a parentless surface of the back
 *     buffer's size);
 *   - level 0 of a host render target texture, for a 2D texture's surface --
 *     the same one SetTexture binds (hle_d3d8_render_texture), so what was
 *     drawn is what the title then samples;
 *   - a face of a host cube texture, for a surface whose parent is a cube
 *     container -- a title's environment map, which it renders each frame and
 *     then samples;
 *   - a scratch target of the surface's size for anything else (other levels,
 *     parentless surfaces of another size), so those passes at least stop
 *     drawing over the screen. Their contents are not used yet.
 * Depth: none when the title passes none. The CreateDevice depth surface with
 * the back buffer is the host device's own; any other request gets a host
 * depth surface of the target's size, since D3D11 accepts depth only at the
 * target's exact size. As on the
