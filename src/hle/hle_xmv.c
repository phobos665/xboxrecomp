/*
 * hle_xmv.c -- replacing the Xbox video library at its API boundary.
 *
 * A title that opens with a logo movie decodes it with XMV, which is linked
 * into the XBE and so is lifted and run like the title's own code. That
 * decoder is some of the least forgiving code in any image: hand-written MMX
 * inner loops fed by pointers that come from the graphics layer. Black faults
 * inside one of them within seconds of starting, having reached nothing else.
 *
 * Refusing to open the file does not help. Black treats a missing movie as
 * fatal -- it calls its own error callback, which asserts and halts -- and it
 * is right to, because on a real disc the file is always there.
 *
 * So the movie is replaced rather than decoded. The title asks the library to
 * create a playback, start it, and then poll it once a frame; this answers
 * those questions without decoding anything, reports the movie as finished
 * after a moment, and lets the title get on with loading. Not one instruction
 * of the title's decoder runs.
 *
 * Finding the boundary
 * --------------------
 * XbSymbolDatabase covers Direct3D, DirectSound and the application library,
 * not this one, so there were addresses and no names. scripts/section_calls.py
 * finds them a different way: each SDK library gets its own named section, so
 * the address range already says which functions belong to it, and the calls
 * that cross into that range from outside are its entry points. For Black
 * that is five functions out of a 163 KB section. The names below are the
 * XDK's own, deduced from what the callers do with each result, and they are
 * bound per title through config/extra_symbols/<title id>.json.
 *
 * The protocol, as the title uses it
 * ----------------------------------
 *   Create(flags, source, &handle)  non-zero return means failure, and the
 *                                   title then calls its error callback
 *   GetStreamInfo(handle, out)      copies the playback object's +0x40, +0x44
 *                                   and +0x48 into out +0, +4 and +0xC
 *   CreateAudioStream(handle, 0, 0, 0, &stream)
 *                                   Future Perfect only; answered with a NULL
 *                                   stream, which the title checks for
 *   Start(handle)                   the title sets its own playing flag after
 *   Update(handle, surface, &status, user)
 *                                   status 0 is no new frame, 1 is a frame
 *                                   ready to present (Future Perfect hands it
 *                                   to D3DDevice_UpdateOverlay), 2 is end of
 *                                   file and 3 failure; both titles leave
 *                                   their loop on 2 or 3
 *   Destroy(handle)                 the title zeroes its handle field after
 *
 * What this does not do
 * ---------------------
 * It draws nothing. The title gets a black screen for the length of the
 * movie, unless RECOMP_FMV_HOST is set, in which case the host's own decoder
 * plays the file when the title opens it and this simply keeps the title's
 * state machine happy alongside it.
 *
 * A title that reads decoded pixels back, or syncs audio to the video clock,
 * would notice. None seen so far does; if one does, the symptom will be a
 * stall rather than a fault, because every call here still answers.
