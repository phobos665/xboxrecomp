/*
 * hle.h -- replacing XDK library functions by name.
 *
 * An implementation is a plain C function marked with HLE_EXPORT(Name), where
 * Name is the XDK function's own name exactly as tools.xdk_symbols reports it
 * (D3DDevice_SetTexture, not SetTexture). tools.recomp scans for the marker,
 * looks the name up in the title's XDK symbols, and generates a thunk from
 * that address's sub_XXXXXXXX to hle_<Name>. See tools/recomp/hle.py.
 *
 * The generated thunk owns the stack. It is reached exactly like a lifted
 * function -- the caller has pushed the guest return address, so at entry
 * [esp] is that address and the first stack argument is at esp+4 -- and after
 * the implementation returns it pops the return address plus the argument
 * bytes the original function's own `ret N` pops. That count is read from the
 * binary, not from the signature database, which gets a few of them wrong;
 * a wrong count leaves esp off in every caller.
 *
 * So an implementation reads its arguments with HLE_ARG (register arguments
 * of a fastcall or thiscall function are g_ecx and g_edx), sets its result
 * with HLE_RETURN, and never moves esp.
