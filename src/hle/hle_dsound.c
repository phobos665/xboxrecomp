/*
 * hle_dsound.c -- DirectSound buffers replaced by name.
 *
 * Adapted from doaxbv-re (https://github.com/NoRain211/doaxbv-re,
 * recomp-runtime/dsound_service_adapter.c), GPL-3.0.
 *
 * The game's own DirectSound drives an emulated MCPX audio chip, and every
 * piece of chip behaviour it relies on has to be found before it works: the
 * codec-ready bit, the DSP doorbells, starting the chip, and then its
 * interrupt, whose handler still declined it. Burnout 2 stops a sound before
 * its attract movie and waits for IDirectSoundBuffer_GetStatus to stop saying
 * PLAYING -- 4.5 million polls, forever.
 *
 * doaxbv-re's answer, reused here: replace the buffer functions and keep each
 * buffer's play state (playing, cursor, loop, frequency) in a model on the
 * host clock (dsound_buffer_model.c), sending the samples to XAudio2
 * (audio_output_xaudio2.cpp). GetStatus then never waits on hardware.
 *
 * Differences from doaxbv-re:
 *  - keyed by XDK function name through tools.xdk_symbols, not by one title's
 *    addresses, so any title on a covered XDK gets it;
 *  - the public IDirectSoundBuffer_* entry points are replaced; creation,
 *    SetVolume and the rest still run the game's own code, which keeps the
 *    settings object this reads current. SetFormat and SetBufferData are
 *    replaced too, but only for a buffer whose settings this file can read
 *    (settings_in_layout); any other buffer gets the game's own code;
 *  - a buffer whose format cannot be played still gets a clock, so status and
 *    position always advance: doaxbv-re fell back to the original function,
 *    which here is the path that hangs;
 *  - a lock, since nothing guarantees one guest thread.
 *
 * Where the fields live (XDK 5344, Burnout 2). The interface pointer the game
 * holds is the buffer object + 0x1C, and the object keeps two settings
 * pointers: +0x1C for the buffer (data, size, play and loop regions -- read
 * by CDirectSoundBufferSettings_SetBufferData, SetLoopRegion and the
 * play-region helper) and +0x10 for the voice (format, rate, alignment,
 * volume -- written by the format packer and CDirectSoundVoice_SetVolume).
 * doaxbv-re reads all of it through the first, which is only right if both
 * point at one object; each field is read here from the one the game's own
 * code writes it to. The offsets inside match doaxbv-re's.

/* ── The service thread ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On the console the audio hardware plays a buffer and consumes a stream's
 * packets by itself; the title only refills them. Here nothing reached the
 * host unless the title happened to call in: a buffer was pumped from inside
 * GetCurrentPosition, GetStatus, Play and DirectSoundDoWork, a stream ticked
 * from DoWork, Process and GetStatus. A title whose audio code pauses -- for a
 * disc read, a page of a graphic novel loading -- left the host voice dry for
 * the length of the pause, and a buffer pump more than 100 ms late threw that
 * stretch of sound away. Max Payne's Bink sound thread polls its 0.6 s movie
 * ring every 20 ms or so but stops for 140-300 ms at a time: up to 640 ms of
 * every five seconds was dropped, the rest crackled.
 *
 * This thread is the hardware's half: every SERVICE_PERIOD_US it pumps each
 * playing buffer and services the streams, whatever the title is doing. The
 * title-driven pumps stay, and they matter: the one inside GetCurrentPosition
 * reads the ring up to the cursor before the title is told the cursor and
 * starts rewriting behind it. It runs no guest code -- it has no guest stack
 * -- so a stream packet whose completion is a guest callback is still
 * completed on a guest thread (hle_dsound_stream.c).
 *
 * RECOMP_DSOUND_SERVICE=0 switches it off, for comparing with the old
