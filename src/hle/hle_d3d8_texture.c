/*
 * hle_d3d8_texture.c -- D3DDevice_SetTexture, forwarded to the shadow device.
 *
 * Part of shadow mode (hle_d3d8.c, RECOMP_HLE_D3D8=shadow). The title's own
 * SetTexture runs first; then the texture it bound is found or built on the
 * host device and bound to the same stage there.
 *
 * An Xbox texture is a guest X_D3DPixelContainer (Cxbx-Reloaded,
 * XbD3D8Types.h): Common, Data, Lock, Format, Size. Data is a physical
 * address; the runtime keeps physical page P at guest 0x80000000 + P, where
 * MmAllocateContiguousMemory allocations live (xbox_memory_layout.c), so the
 * texels are read there. Format packs the D3DFORMAT (bits 8-15), mip levels
 * (16-19) and, for swizzled and compressed textures, log2 width and height
 * (20-23, 24-27). A linear texture instead has a non-zero Size: width-1,
 * height-1 and pitch/64-1, and one level (CxbxGetPixelContainerMeasures in
 * XbConvert.cpp).
 *
 * The host D3D8 layer takes Xbox format codes itself and keeps a mip chain in
 * the Xbox's own packing -- level after level, each row_pitch * rows -- which
 * it unswizzles and converts at upload. So swizzled and compressed levels are
 * copied as they are. That the guest packs its levels with no padding between
 * them is assumed, not verified.
 *
 * Titles write texels without any call the replacement could see (Lock is
 * inline), so a cached texture is checksummed again the first time it is
 * bound in each frame and uploaded again if it changed.
 *
 * P8 is forwarded: the host expands palettised texels to BGRA at upload
 * through the palette of the stage the texture is bound to, and
 * D3DDevice_SetPalette at the end of this file supplies that palette from the
 * guest's own resource. Because the expansion is baked, the palette a host
 * texture was baked with is remembered, and it is baked again when it is
 * drawn under a different one (sync_palette).
 *
 * Not handled, counted instead: cube and volume textures, surfaces bound as
 * textures, textures outside the contiguous window, and any format
 * d3d8_format_bpp does not know (named in the log when one is refused).
