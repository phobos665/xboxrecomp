/*
 * hle_d3d8_texture.c -- D3DDevice_SetTexture, forwarded to the shadow device.
 *
 * Part of shadow mode (hle_d3d8.c, RECOMP_HLE_D3D8=shadow). The title's own
 * SetTexture runs first; then the texture it bound is found or built on the
 * host device and bound to the same stage there.
 *
 * An Xbox texture is a guest X_D3DPixelContainer (Cxbx-Reloaded,
 * XbD3D8Types.h): Common, Data, Lock, Format, Size. Data is a physical
 * address; the runtime keeps physical page P at guest 0x80000000 + P, where
 * MmAllocateContiguousMemory allocations live (xbox_memory_layout.c), so the
 * texels are read there. Format packs the D3DFORMAT (bits 8-15), mip levels
 * (16-19) and, for swizzled and compressed textures, log2 width and height
 * (20-23, 24-27). A linear texture instead has a non-zero Size: width-1,
 * height-1 and pitch/64-1, and one level (CxbxGetPixelContainerMeasures in
 * XbConvert.cpp).
 *
 * The host D3D8 layer takes Xbox format codes itself and keeps a mip chain in
 * the Xbox's own packing -- level after level, each row_pitch * rows -- which
 * it unswizzles and converts at upload. So swizzled and compressed levels are
 * copied as they are. That the guest packs its levels with no padding between
 * them is assumed, not verified.
 *
 * Titles write texels without any call the replacement could see (Lock is
 * inline), so a cached texture is checksummed again the first time it is
 * bound in each frame and uploaded again if it changed.
 *
 * P8 is forwarded: the host expands palettised texels to BGRA at upload
 * through the palette of the stage the texture is bound to, and
 * D3DDevice_SetPalette at the end of this file supplies that palette from the
 * guest's own resource. Because the expansion is baked, the palette a host
 * texture was baked with is remembered, and it is baked again when it is
 * drawn under a different one (sync_palette).
 *
 * Not handled, counted instead: cube and volume textures, surfaces bound as
 * textures, textures outside the contiguous window, and any format
 * d3d8_format_bpp does not know (named in the log when one is refused).

/* Texture memory: a byte budget and an age-out, on top of the entry count.

 * The 512 entries alone let textures from levels long gone hold host and GPU
 * memory until 512 newer ones push them out, and nothing notices the guest
 * freeing or reusing their memory. So an entry uploaded from guest texels
 * also counts its bytes (entry_bytes), and:
 *
 *   RECOMP_HLE_D3D8_TEX_BUDGET_MB=<n> (default 256, 0 = no budget): while
 *     uploaded entries hold more than n MB, the least recently bound one is
 *     released.
 *   RECOMP_HLE_D3D8_TEX_AGE=<frames> (default 0, off): at the end of a frame,
 *     an uploaded entry not bound for that many frames is released.
 *
 * Only entries that can be rebuilt from guest memory go (evictable): never
 * one bound to a stage, one used this frame, or anything the host drew --
 * render target textures and surfaces, the frame buffer copy -- whose content
 * exists nowhere else. A released texture that comes back is uploaded again
 * from the guest's bytes, as a new one is, so the cost is a re-upload and
 * never a wrong picture. A P8 texture's palette variants are entries of
 * their own and go one at a time like any other.
 *
 * The bytes are the mip chain in the guest's packing, P8 at four bytes a
 * texel because the host expands it. The host keeps a CPU copy as well as the
 * GPU texture (d3d8_resources.c sys_mem), so what is held is about twice the
 * figure. Age-out is off by default because the budget already bounds the
 * memory, and what it adds -- returning a texture's memory sooner -- is paid
 * for with a re-upload when a title comes back to an old screen. */

 * and nothing else). 256 entries of ARGB8888, which is what the device keeps.
 *
 * Only remembered here. The hardware reads the palette at each draw, so
 * sync_palette reads it there too and picks the host texture baked with it.
 * A null palette means the device's grey ramp, not whatever was there last.
 *
 * The host's palettes go through host_SetPalette (host_stage_palette), so a
 * capture records them (D3D8CAP_PALETTE, format 7) and a replayed frame
 * expands its P8 textures through the palettes the title set.
