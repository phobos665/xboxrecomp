/*
 * hle_xmv_play.h -- actually playing a movie behind the XMV replacement.
 *
 * hle_xmv.c answers the library's calls; this decodes the file those calls
 * name (src/video: xmv_demux, xmv_decode), puts each picture on the host's
 * movie layer (d3d8_movie) and the sound on a voice of its own
 * (RECOMP_AUDIO_SLOT_MOVIE). docs/technical/video-playback.md has the design.
 *
 * Every function is safe to call when playback is unavailable: open returns
 * 0 and hle_xmv.c keeps its old behaviour of reporting the movie over.
