/*
 * d3d8_capture.h -- the D3D8 frame capture container: one frame of the calls
 * shadow mode made on the HOST renderer, plus every byte they read.
 *
 * Why this exists: reaching an interesting frame in shadow mode
 * (hle_d3d8.c, RECOMP_HLE_D3D8=shadow) means running the title for minutes
 * and driving menus, and what the renderer does is then never quite the same
 * twice. A capture is the same frame every time, replays in seconds from
 * src/replay with no game running, and so turns a change to the shader
 * translation into an image to look at rather than another play-through.
 *
 * Why the host boundary (version 2). Version 1 recorded the title's Xbox
 * values, and the replay tool repeated shadow mode's Xbox-to-host conversion.
 * That conversion kept growing -- vertex declarations, NORMPACKED3 unpacking,
 * the screen-space undo and its constants, the per-draw viewport choice,
 * pixel shader forwarding -- and every piece the replay did not copy made a
 * replayed frame differ from the live one. Now the capture holds exactly what
 * src/hle handed to src/d3d, after all conversion, and replay is a player
 * with no Xbox knowledge: it calls the same host functions with the same
 * arguments. A replay therefore shows what the host renderer does with the
 * frame. It cannot be used to re-examine the Xbox-to-host conversion; that
 * needs a live run.
 *
 * This file is the container only: no Direct3D, no Windows, no guest memory.
 * It builds on every platform so the round-trip test (tests/d3d8_capture)
 * runs in the Linux CI job as well as the Windows one. The writer's driver is
 * hle_d3d8_record.c, Windows-only like the rest of shadow mode; the reader's
 * is src/replay.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ layout
 *
 * Little-endian throughout, and no packing pragmas: every field of every
 * payload struct below is a 4-byte uint32_t, int32_t or float, so each struct
 * is the same size and shape on MSVC x64 and gcc x86-64. Host enum values
 * (D3DRENDERSTATETYPE, D3DFORMAT, DXGI_FORMAT, ...) are stored as uint32_t,
 * which is their size on both. Guest and hosts are all little-endian
 * (CLAUDE.md), so nothing is byte-swapped. A capture is NOT a long-term
 * archive format, and the version is checked exactly, not ranged.
 *
 *   D3D8CapHeader                      (32 bytes, at offset 0)
 *   then chunk_count chunks:
 *     uint32_t type;                   D3D8CAP_* below
 *     uint32_t bytes;                  payload length, NOT counting these 8
 *     uint8_t  payload[bytes];
 *     uint8_t  pad[];                  to the next 4-byte boundary
 *
 * A capture has two parts, in this order:
 *   1. a snapshot of the host's state at the frame boundary, read back from
 *      src/d3d itself rather than from src/hle's change caches, and ended by
 *      one D3D8CAP_FRAME_START chunk;
 *   2. every host call shadow mode made until the next Swap, in call order.
 * The snapshot uses the same chunk types as the calls, so replay has one path
 * for both. Its order is fixed by the writer: programs and their
 * declarations, constants, screen-space, input current values, combiner
 * token, vertex shader,
 * textures, render target, transforms, viewport, render states, texture
 * stage states. The
 * stage states come after the textures because the host's SetTexture
 * rewrites D3DTSS_COLOROP (d3d8_device.c, dev_SetTexture).
 *
 * Handles. Vertex program handles are the host's own (d3d8_vsh.c, slot +
 * 0x10000). Replay creates its own programs and maps each recorded handle to
 * the one it got. Textures are numbered by the capture: a host texture object
 * gets an id the first time the capture needs its contents, and
 * D3D8CAP_TEXTURE_RELEASE retires the id when shadow mode releases the
 * object, so an object reallocated at the same address gets a new id.
 *
 * Not in the format:
 *   - push-buffer traffic. A title that fills its own push buffer through
 *     BeginPush (Burnout 2 does, at two call sites -- see hle_d3d8.c)
 *     bypasses every replacement, so shadow mode never draws those, and
 *     neither does a replay.
 *   - host state src/hle never sets: lights, material, palettes, stream
 *     sources, the device's own pixel shader handle. A replay leaves them at
 *     the device's defaults, as the live run does.
 *   - what a render target held before the frame. Its TEXTURE chunk carries
 *     the host's system-memory copy, which rendering never writes, so a
 *     target drawn in an earlier frame and only sampled in this one replays
 *     as zeros.
 *   - cube and volume textures, which shadow mode does not create. One bound
 *     on a stage would be recorded as nothing bound.
 *   - anything time-varying: no timestamps, no frame pacing.
