/*
 * recomp_pad.h -- the host's game pads, whichever API reads them.
 *
 * Two APIs sit behind this. SDL3 is the default on every platform: it
 * reads Xbox pads and everything else -- DualSense and DualShock 4,
 * Switch Pro, 8BitDo, the Steam Deck's controls, generic pads through
 * SDL's mapping database -- with hotplug and rumble for all of them.
 * XInput is kept on Windows behind a switch (RECOMP_PAD_API=xinput, or
 * "pad_api": "xinput" in the bindings file the launcher writes), for a pad
 * or a machine where SDL3 misbehaves.
 *
 * State comes back in XInput's layout whichever API read it: its button
 * bits, triggers 0..255, sticks -32768..32767 with up positive. Everything
 * above this -- the bindings, the launcher's menus and its press capture --
 * was written against that layout and does not change.
 *
 * Slots are 0..3. With SDL3 a pad takes the first free slot when it is
 * connected and keeps it until it is unplugged, so a second pad plugged in
 * mid-game is pad 2 and pad 1 does not move. With XInput a slot is XInput's
 * own user index.
