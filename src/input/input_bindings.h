/*
 * input_bindings.h -- host devices and per-control bindings, from a config
 * file, for all four Xbox controller ports.
 *
 * One place decides what the four guest pads read: which host device stands
 * in for each port, and which key or pad control drives each of the title's
 * 24 inputs. Both input paths use it -- the XAPI replacement in src/hle and
 * the USB gamepad in src/usb -- so a binding changed once applies to a title
 * whichever way it reads its pads.
 *
 * The file is JSON, written by `py -3 -m tools.input_ui`; see
 * docs/technical/input-binding.md for the format and the search order. With
 * no file present the built-in defaults are what the runtime always did:
 * XInput pad 0 plus the keyboard on port 1, XInput pad N on port N.
