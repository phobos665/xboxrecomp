/*
 * d3d8_replay.c -- replay one captured frame into the host renderer.
 *
 * The point of the whole capture path: change the shader translation, the
 * combiners or the state handling in src/d3d, rebuild, and look at the new
 * image in seconds instead of running the title for five minutes and driving
 * its menus to the moment of interest. A capture replays byte-identically
 * every time, so two images differ only where the code changed.
 *
 *   d3d8_replay <capture> [--out <prefix>] [--loops <n>] [--dump-every]
 *               [--hold] [--quiet]
 *
 *   --out <prefix>   BMP path prefix (default "replay"); files are
 *                    <prefix>NNN.bmp, in the same 24-bit format the shadow
 *                    path's RECOMP_HLE_D3D8_DUMP writes, so a replay image
 *                    and a live frame can be put side by side.
 *   --loops <n>      replay the frame n times (default 1). The device is
 *                    created once; each loop walks the capture again from
 *                    its snapshot.
 *   --dump-every     write a BMP after every loop, not just the last, so a
 *                    frame that is not idempotent shows itself.
 *   --hold           leave the window up until it is closed.
 *   --quiet          only errors.
 *   --no-combiners   draw with the fixed-function pixel path whatever the
 *                    capture's combiner token says.
 *   --draws <n>      execute only the first n draws (state still applied;
 *                    clears after the nth draw are skipped too).
 *   --skip-draw <n>  leave out draw n (0-based).
 *   --list-draws     print every draw with the state it runs under.
 *   --dump-target    write the render target bound when the frame ends
 *                    instead of the back buffer: with --draws, the way to see
 *                    an offscreen pass that is composited to the screen later.
 *   --present        also write <prefix>NNN_present.bmp: the frame as it
 *                    reaches the swap chain, after the display resolve, which
 *                    the scene image (the default) never shows.
 *   --backend <name> the renderer backend to replay through (d3d11, vulkan);
 *                    the same as setting RECOMP_D3D8_BACKEND. Replaying one
 *                    capture through two backends and diffing the images is
 *                    scripts/replay_ab.py.
 *   --place <tag>=<p>  replay the title's widescreen 2D placement for tag
 *                    (hex, or "all") as p: auto, stretch, centre, left,
 *                    right or side. Repeatable. Needs RECOMP_WIDESCREEN=1 to show,
 *                    and is how a title project tries its placement table
 *                    on a captured frame instead of a run.
 *   --solo-tag <tag> draw the untagged draws (the 3D) and only this tag's
 *                    2D: what one of the title's call sites draws.
 *   --each-tag       replay once as captured, then once per tag seen, solo,
 *                    to <prefix>_<tag>.bmp. One capture then shows every
 *                    call site in a frame, which is how a title project
 *                    finds which of its sites is which piece of the HUD.
 *   --hide-tag <tag> draw everything but this tag's draws.
 *   --each-tag-hidden  as --each-tag, but each image leaves one tag out.
 *                    For a layer that only shows blended over the others
 *                    (a multiplied or added backdrop), which solo draws
 *                    over black and so draws as nothing: its difference
 *                    from the full frame is what it contributes.
 *
 * A player, not an emulator. A capture holds the calls shadow mode
 * made on the host renderer after all of its Xbox conversion (d3d8_capture.h),
 * so this file has no Xbox knowledge at all: each chunk is one call into
 * src/d3d with the recorded arguments. The only translation is of handles --
 * vertex program handles and texture objects are this process's own, so the
 * recorded ones are mapped to them. If a replayed frame differs from the live
 * one, the difference is in the capture, or in what src/d3d does with the
 * same calls; it cannot come from a second copy of shadow mode's logic.
 *
 * No game files, no recompiled title and no guest memory. It links the host
 * D3D8 layer (src/d3d) directly and creates the device the same way
 * hle_d3d8.c's shadow_create does.
 *
 * Between loops every program, texture and depth surface this tool created
 * is deleted and the back buffer is made the target again, so each loop
 * starts from the capture's snapshot alone. What the snapshot does
 * not carry (d3d8_capture.h, "Not in the format") stays as the device left
 * it, which is the device's default because nothing here sets it either.
