/*
 * host_timer.h - a timer that wakes when asked, on every host.
 *
 * Three runtime threads pace themselves to well under a millisecond: the
 * vblank clock (kernel_bridge.c), the flip gate's lent wait and the NV2A ack
 * thread's idle wait (xbox_memory_layout.c). A plain Sleep cannot do that --
 * the Windows scheduler tick is 15.6 ms -- so each used a high-resolution
 * waitable timer. This is that timer with the Win32 calls behind it:
 *
 *   Windows  CreateWaitableTimerExW(CREATE_WAITABLE_TIMER_HIGH_RESOLUTION),
 *            Windows 10 1803+, about 0.5 ms; optionally falling back to a
 *            plain waitable timer, exactly as the three callers did.
 *   macOS    mach_wait_until on an absolute mach_absolute_time deadline.
 *   Linux    clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME).
 *
 * A host_timer belongs to one thread at a time: it is not a shared object.
 * Periodic waits are a deadline the caller advances by its period
 * (host_timer_wait_until), so a late wake does not push every later one.
