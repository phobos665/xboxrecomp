/*
 * launcher_bindings.h -- the input config, as the launcher edits it.
 *
 * The runtime reads this same file (src/input/input_bindings.c) and
 * resolves every string to a key code or a pad index at load. The
 * launcher needs the strings themselves, to show them and to change
 * them, so it keeps its own view: the file's text, not the runtime's
 * resolved form.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the runtime's and nothing here may invent any of
 * it. A control the runtime does not know is a binding that silently
 * does nothing, which is worse than refusing to write it, so the names
 * below are the runtime's table copied deliberately and checked against
 * it by tools/input_ui/test_runtime_vocabulary.py.
 *
 * Bindings belong to the person, not the title: one file, shared by
 * every game the toolkit builds, in the place the runtime looks.
