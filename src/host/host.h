/*
 * host.h -- the host shell off Windows: the main-thread event loop and the
 * game window, on SDL3.
 *
 * Why a loop on the main thread. On macOS every window, view and Metal layer
 * belongs to the thread that ran main() (SDL's Cocoa driver refuses to start
 * anywhere else), while a title's D3D8 calls arrive on guest threads. So on
 * POSIX the title runs on a thread of its own (src/platform's
 * host_main_posix) and the main thread runs recomp_host_loop_run, which does
 * every piece of window work the guest threads ask for and delivers the
 * window's events. On Windows nothing here is used: the D3D8 replacement
 * keeps its own Win32 window thread (src/hle/hle_d3d8.c).
 *
 * The loop starts SDL's video only when the first window is asked for, so a
 * run with no window (RECOMP_HLE_D3D8=off) never becomes an application the
 * window server knows about, and cannot take the focus.
 *
 * RECOMP_WINDOW_BACKGROUND=1 opens the window without activating the process
 * or giving the window the keyboard focus, below the windows already there,
 * and never fullscreen -- the same promise the Win32 window makes
 * (SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE, HWND_BOTTOM), for a run a script drives while someone
 * works at the same desk. On macOS it also keeps the process out of the Dock
 * and the app switcher.
