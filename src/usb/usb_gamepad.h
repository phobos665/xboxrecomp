 * usb_gamepad.h -- the device on the other end of the wire.
 *
 * A host controller moves bytes; it does not know what they mean. This is the
 * thing that answers them: an Xbox controller, as the console's own USB stack
 * expects to find it -- standard descriptors over endpoint 0, and a 20-byte
 * report over interrupt endpoint 1.
 *
 * Kept apart from ohci.c because it is a different concern. The controller
 * walks descriptor lists and raises interrupts and would do the same for a
 * memory unit or a headset; this knows one device and nothing about lists.
