/**
 * NV2A Vertex Shader Microcode to HLSL Translator
 *
 * The Xbox NV2A GPU has a programmable vertex shader unit compatible with
 * (and extending) the original GeForce3/4 vertex shader architecture.
 * Games upload sequences of 128-bit microcode instructions via
 * D3DDevice_CreateVertexShader(). At draw time, the NV2A executes
 * these instructions in its vertex shader pipeline.
 *
 * This module translates NV2A vertex shader microcode into HLSL source
 * code, compiles it with D3DCompile, and caches the resulting
 * ID3D11VertexShader for use by the D3D8->D3D11 compatibility layer.
 *
 * Decoding the microcode and running it on the CPU is not here. That half
 * needs no graphics API, so it lives in src/kernel/nv2a_vsh.{c,h} and builds
 * on every platform; the instruction set, register model and the types
 * NV2AVshProgram and NV2AVshState are documented there. This header adds only
 * what is specific to the Direct3D 11 path.
 *
