 * d3d8_display.h -- the size the host renders at, and the pass that gets

 * The guest presents at its own size (640x480 for most titles) and every
 * draw path already ends in normalised coordinates: vertex programs have
 * their screen-space transform undone, the fixed-function path is
 * transformed by the host, and pre-transformed vertices divide by the
 * guest's presentation size. So a larger host target re-rasterises the
 * same scene rather than magnifying it, and nothing needs resampling.
 *
 * That is the whole mechanism behind both supersampling and, later,
 * widescreen: render the scene at a size of the host's choosing, then
 * resolve it down onto a swap chain that still matches the window.
