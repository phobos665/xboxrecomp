# Controller bindings

*September 2026.*

Until now a recompiled title got one pad, on port 1, driven by XInput pad 0
and a keyboard map written into `src/hle/input_host.c`. Nothing could be
rebound, a second player could not be plugged in, and the only way to change a
key was to edit C and rebuild every title.

There are now three pieces:

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/input/input_bindings.c` | reads the config, samples the four ports |
| `tools/input_ui/` | the UI that writes the config (`py -3 -m tools.input_ui`) |
| `tools/input_ui/bindings.py` | the schema both sides speak, and its tests |

Every title built from this toolkit picks it up: the binding layer is part of
`xbox_input`, which `xbox_hle` and `xbox_usb` both link, so a title only has
to be rebuilt, not changed.

## The file

JSON, one entry per controller:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "controllers": [
    {
      "port": 1,
      "device": "xinput:0",
      "deadzone": 7849,
      "bindings": {
        "a": ["pad:a", "key:Z"],
        "start": "key:RETURN",
        "lstick_left": ["pad:lx-", "key:A"],
        "black": "none"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Ports are **1-4**, as they are written on the console. A controller the file
does not mention keeps its defaults, and so does a control the file does not
mention -- a file with one binding in it is a config with one binding changed.
That is deliberate: it makes the file hand-editable and a diff readable.

**`device`** is `keyboard`, `xinput:0` .. `xinput:3`, or `none`. It says where
`pad:` sources are read from. `key:` sources are always read, whatever the
device is, which is why the default port 1 answers to both a pad and the
keyboard at once.

**A binding** is one source string or a list of up to four. Any of them
pressing the control presses it, and the strongest wins for anything analog,
so a trigger bound to both a key and a pad trigger behaves sensibly. `"none"`
or `[]` unbinds.

**Sources**

| form | meaning |
|---|---|
| `key:Z`, `key:7` | a letter or digit |
| `key:RETURN`, `key:LSHIFT`, `key:F8`, `key:SLASH` | a named key (the list is `KEYS[]` in `input_bindings.c`, mirrored in `bindings.py`) |
| `key:#191` | a raw Windows virtual-key code, for anything with no name |
| `pad:a` `pad:b` `pad:x` `pad:y` | face buttons on the host pad |
| `pad:lshoulder` `pad:rshoulder` | shoulder buttons (the Xbox's Black and White by default) |
| `pad:start` `pad:back` `pad:lthumb` `pad:rthumb` | the rest of the digital buttons |
| `pad:dpad_up` .. `pad:dpad_right` | the host D-pad |
| `pad:lt` `pad:rt` | analog triggers, 0-255 |
| `pad:lx+` `pad:lx-` `pad:ly+` .. `pad:ry-` | one half of one stick axis |

**Controls** are the 24 inputs an Xbox pad has: `a b x y black white start
back ltrigger rtrigger`, `dpad_up/down/left/right`, `lthumb`, `rthumb`, and
each stick as four halves -- `lstick_up/down/left/right` and `rstick_*`.

A stick is four halves rather than two axes because a key has no middle. It
also means every source, whatever it is, reads as one 0-255 magnitude:
a digital control fires above a quarter press, an analog button takes the
magnitude, and a stick axis is the positive half minus the negative one,
scaled to the signed 16 bits the guest reads. Binding a trigger to a key
gives a full pull; binding a stick half to a key gives a full deflection.

### Where it lives

Both sides look in the same places, in this order:

1. `RECOMP_INPUT_CONFIG`, if set -- an explicit path, and a run says so if it
   cannot be read rather than silently falling back;
2. `%APPDATA%\xboxrecomp\input_bindings.json` (on POSIX,
   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xboxrecomp/input_bindings.json`) -- the per-user file the
   UI writes by default;
3. `input_bindings.json` in the working directory, which for a title started
   by its `run.bat` is the directory the executable sits in, so a title can
   ship a config of its own.

Bindings are per-user rather than per-title on purpose: they belong to the
person and their hardware, and a toolkit that builds several titles should not
make them rebind for each one. A title that genuinely needs its own gets one
through (3), and a test run gets one through (1).

### Defaults, when there is no file

Exactly what the runtime did before this existed, so nothing changes for a run
that has not been configured:

- controller 1: XInput pad 0 **and** the keyboard -- arrows = D-pad,
  Enter = START, Backspace = BACK, Z = A, X = B, A = X, S = Y, Q = White,
  W = Black, E = left trigger, R = right trigger;
- controllers 2-4: XInput pad 1, 2, 3, pad only.

The sticks have no keyboard default. Every comfortable key around WASD is
already a button in that map, and guessing would have silently changed what
existing runs do.

## The UI

```
py -3 -m tools.input_ui                  # the per-user config
py -3 -m tools.input_ui path\to.json     # somewhere else
py -3 -m tools.input_ui --print          # what the runtime would load
py -3 -m tools.input_ui --write-defaults # a default file, no display needed
```

Four controllers down the left as dashboard blades; the selected one's device
across the top -- the keyboard, each XInput slot with whether a pad is
answering right now, or nothing; every control below it. Clicking a binding
(or `Bind`) opens a capture: press a key or a button and it is taken, `+` adds
a second source to the same control, Esc cancels, and the dialog has a button
to clear. `Reset this controller`, `Reset all four`, `Save`.

It is tkinter with every colour set by hand -- black field, `#0D0D0D` panels,
`#107C10` for structure and `#9BE04B` for anything with focus or a value. ttk
on Windows will not let a widget be black, and `tk.Scrollbar` keeps the
system's white trough whatever it is told, so the scrollbar is drawn here too.

Device detection is XInput through `ctypes` (`tools/input_ui/devices.py`): it
tries `xinput1_4`, `xinput1_3`, then `xinput9_1_0`, and asks each of the four
slots. DirectInput and raw HID are not read -- an Xbox-layout pad is what
XInput reports, and anything else would need a translation layer the toolkit
does not have. A pad that is not detected can still be bound and configured;
the port simply reports empty until it is plugged in.

Capture compares against the pad state taken when the dialog opened, so a
stick resting off centre or a trigger resting high does not bind itself.

## What the runtime does with it

`recomp_bindings_init()` runs once, from whichever input path is reached
first, and logs what it read:

```
[INPUT] bindings from C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\xboxrecomp\input_bindings.json
[INPUT]   controller 1: keyboard
[INPUT]   controller 2: nothing
[INPUT] XAPI input replaced by name: 1 pad(s); gamepad type 0x0028C054
[INPUT]   port 1 <- keyboard
[INPUT] XInputOpen port 1 (keyboard) -> handle 0x58490001
[INPUT] port 1 first press: start (keyboard)
```

That last line is named once per port, the first time anything is pressed on
it. A wrong binding is otherwise invisible -- the title just does not respond,
and there is no way to tell a mis-bound key from a title that is not reading
its pads at all.

`src/hle/hle_input.c` now reports **up to four ports**. A port is present when
its device is the keyboard, or when its XInput pad answers, or when it has
keyboard bindings as well (which is why the default port 1 is always there).
`XGetDevices` and `XGetDeviceChanges` re-check, so a pad plugged in while the
title runs arrives as an insertion the way the console reported one, and
`XInputGetState` samples the device bound to that handle's own port.

Sources are resolved to key codes and pad indices once, at load, so a poll
does no string work; a poll reads each distinct key once and its pad once. An
empty XInput slot is re-checked only once a second, because `XInputGetState`
on one costs about a millisecond and a title polls several times a frame --
that was true before this change too, and silently cost more than the game on
a machine with no pad.

`RECOMP_FAKE_INPUT` and `RECOMP_INPUT_SEQ` are unchanged and apply to
controller 1 after its bindings. They stand in for a person at the keyboard,
so what that person bound should not change them.

`src/usb/usb_gamepad.c` reports port 1 through the same bindings, so a title
that finds its pad through the emulated USB stack rather than the XAPI
replacement behaves the same.

## Tests

```
py -3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p "test_*.py" -t .
```

`tools/input_ui/test_bindings.py` covers the half that needs no device:
defaults, what a partial or broken file means, which sources are valid, and
that a saved config reloads identical.

`tools/input_ui/test_runtime_vocabulary.py` reads `CONTROLS`, `PAD_BUTTONS`,
`KEYS` and `DEFAULTS` out of `src/input/input_bindings.c` and fails if the
Python copies have drifted. Drift is the dangerous failure here: the UI would
write a name the runtime does not recognise, the file would save, and the
control would simply never fire.

## Verified

Burnout 2, built from this branch:

- with no config file: boots as before, one pad on port 1, the log naming the
  built-in defaults;
- with a config naming `keyboard` on port 1, `none` on port 2 and START bound
  to `key:F8`: the log named the file and the devices, and pressing F8 came
  through as `port 1 first press: start`.

## Not done

- **Hot reload.** The config is read once, at start-up. Re-reading it when the
  file changes would be a few lines, but a binding that changes mid-frame
  wants thinking about.
- **DirectInput and raw HID**, so a PlayStation or generic pad appears without
  a third-party translation layer.
- **Rumble** goes to the model and no further: nothing drives the host pad's
  motors yet, on any port.
- **Per-title overrides** beyond dropping a file next to the executable -- no
  profiles, no per-title directory in the per-user config.
- **A POSIX backend.** The parser is portable and builds anywhere; the
  sampling is XInput and `GetAsyncKeyState`, so on POSIX every port reads
  neutral until an SDL2 backend exists (the same gap `src/hle`'s audio and
  input backends already have).
- **Memory units and other XPP devices.** Only gamepads are bound; the model
  still answers "nothing connected" for everything else.
